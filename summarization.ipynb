       "'\\nW\\nhen he went into Sonia’s room, it was already getting \\ndark. All day Sonia had been waiting for him in ter-\\nrible anxiety. Dounia had been waiting with her. She had \\ncome to her that morning, remembering Svidrigaïlov’s \\nwords that Sonia knew. We will not describe the conver-\\nsation and tears of the two girls, and how friendly they \\nbecame. Dounia gained one comfort at least from that in-\\nterview, that her brother would not be alone. He had gone \\nto her, Sonia, first with his confession; he had gone to her \\nfor human fellowship when he needed it; she would go with \\nhim wherever fate might send him. Dounia did not ask, but \\nshe knew it was so. She looked at Sonia almost with rever-\\nence and at first almost embarrassed her by it. Sonia was \\nalmost on the point of tears. She felt herself, on the contrary, \\nhardly worthy to look at Dounia. Dounia’s gracious image \\nwhen she had bowed to her so attentively and respectfully at \\ntheir first meeting in Raskolnikov’s room had remained in \\nher mind as one of the fairest visions of her life.\\nDounia at last became impatient and, leaving Sonia, went \\nto her brother’s room to await him there; she kept thinking \\nthat he would come there first. When she had gone, Sonia \\nbegan to be tortured by the dread of his committing suicide, \\nand Dounia too feared it. But they had spent the day trying \\nto persuade each other that that could not be, and both were \\nCrime and Punishment\\n730\\nless anxious while they were together. As soon as they part-\\ned, each thought of nothing else. Sonia remembered how \\nSvidrigaïlov had said to her the day before that Raskolnikov \\nhad two alternatives—Siberia or … Besides she knew his \\nvanity, his pride and his lack of faith.\\n‘Is it possible that he has nothing but cowardice and fear \\nof death to make him live?’ she thought at last in despair.\\nMeanwhile the sun was setting. Sonia was standing in \\ndejection, looking intently out of the window, but from it \\nshe could see nothing but the unwhitewashed blank wall \\nof the next house. At last when she began to feel sure of his \\ndeath—he walked into the room.\\nShe gave a cry of joy, but looking carefully into his face \\nshe turned pale.\\n‘Yes,’ said Raskolnikov, smiling. ‘I have come for your \\ncross, Sonia. It was you told me to go to the cross-roads; \\nwhy is it you are frightened now it’s come to that?’\\nSonia gazed at him astonished. His tone seemed strange \\nto her; a cold shiver ran over her, but in a moment she \\nguessed that the tone and the words were a mask. He spoke \\nto her looking away, as though to avoid meeting her eyes.\\n‘You see, Sonia, I’ve decided that it will be better so. \\nThere is one fact…. But it’s a long story and there’s no need \\nto discuss it. But do you know what angers me? It annoys \\nme that all those stupid brutish faces will be gaping at me \\ndirectly, pestering me with their stupid questions, which \\nI shall have to answer—they’ll point their fingers at me…. \\nTfoo! You know I am not going to Porfiry, I am sick of him. \\nI’d rather go to my friend, the Explosive Lieutenant; how \\n731\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nI shall surprise him, what a sensation I shall make! But I \\nmust be cooler; I’ve become too irritable of late. You know I \\nwas nearly shaking my fist at my sister just now, because she \\nturned to take a last look at me. It’s a brutal state to be in! \\nAh! what am I coming to! Well, where are the crosses?’\\nHe seemed hardly to know what he was doing. He could \\nnot stay still or concentrate his attention on anything; his \\nideas seemed to gallop after one another, he talked incoher-\\nently, his hands trembled slightly.\\nWithout a word Sonia took out of the drawer two crosses, \\none of cypress wood and one of copper. She made the sign \\nof the cross over herself and over him, and put the wooden \\ncross on his neck.\\n‘It’s the symbol of my taking up the cross,’ he laughed. \\n‘As though I had not suffered much till now! The wooden \\ncross, that is the peasant one; the copper one, that is Lizave-\\nta’s—you will wear yourself, show me! So she had it on … at \\nthat moment? I remember two things like these too, a silver \\none and a little ikon. I threw them back on the old wom-\\nan’s neck. Those would be appropriate now, really, those are \\nwhat I ought to put on now…. But I am talking nonsense \\nand forgetting what matters; I’m somehow forgetful…. You \\nsee I have come to warn you, Sonia, so that you might know \\n… that’s all— that’s all I came for. But I thought I had more \\nto say. You wanted me to go yourself. Well, now I am going \\nto prison and you’ll have your wish. Well, what are you cry-\\ning for? You too? Don’t. Leave off! Oh, how I hate it all!’\\nBut his feeling was stirred; his heart ached, as he looked \\nat her. ‘Why is she grieving too?’ he thought to himself. \\nCrime and Punishment\\n732\\n‘What am I to her? Why does she weep? Why is she looking \\nafter me, like my mother or Dounia? She’ll be my nurse.’\\n‘Cross yourself, say at least one prayer,’ Sonia begged in a \\ntimid broken voice.\\n‘Oh certainly, as much as you like! And sincerely, Sonia, \\nsincerely….’\\nBut he wanted to say something quite different.\\nHe crossed himself several times. Sonia took up her \\nshawl and put it over her head. It was the green drap de \\ndames shawl of which Marmeladov had spoken, ‘the fam-\\nily shawl.’ Raskolnikov thought of that looking at it, but \\nhe did not ask. He began to feel himself that he was cer-\\ntainly forgetting things and was disgustingly agitated. He \\nwas frightened at this. He was suddenly struck too by the \\nthought that Sonia meant to go with him.\\n‘What are you doing? Where are you going? Stay here, \\nstay! I’ll go alone,’ he cried in cowardly vexation, and al-\\nmost resentful, he moved towards the door. ‘What’s the use \\nof going in procession?’ he muttered going out.\\nSonia remained standing in the middle of the room. He \\nhad not even said good-bye to her; he had forgotten her. A \\npoignant and rebellious doubt surged in his heart.\\n‘Was it right, was it right, all this?’ he thought again as \\nhe went down the stairs. ‘Couldn’t he stop and retract it all \\n… and not go?’\\nBut still he went. He felt suddenly once for all that he \\nmustn’t ask himself questions. As he turned into the street \\nhe remembered that he had not said good-bye to Sonia, that \\nhe had left her in the middle of the room in her green shawl, \\n733\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nnot daring to stir after he had shouted at her, and he stopped \\nshort for a moment. At the same instant, another thought \\ndawned upon him, as though it had been lying in wait to \\nstrike him then.\\n‘Why, with what object did I go to her just now? I told \\nher—on business; on what business? I had no sort of busi-\\nness! To tell her I was going; but where was the need? Do I \\nlove her? No, no, I drove her away just now like a dog. Did I \\nwant her crosses? Oh, how low I’ve sunk! No, I wanted her \\ntears, I wanted to see her terror, to see how her heart ached! \\nI had to have something to cling to, something to delay me, \\nsome friendly face to see! And I dared to believe in myself, \\nto dream of what I would do! I am a beggarly contemptible \\nwretch, contemptible!’\\nHe walked along the canal bank, and he had not much \\nfurther to go. But on reaching the bridge he stopped and \\nturning out of his way along it went to the Hay Market.\\nHe looked eagerly to right and left, gazed intently at \\nevery object and could not fix his attention on anything; \\neverything slipped away. ‘In another week, another month \\nI shall be driven in a prison van over this bridge, how shall \\nI look at the canal then? I should like to remember this!’ \\nslipped into his mind. ‘Look at this sign! How shall I read \\nthose letters then? It’s written here ‘Campany,’ that’s a \\nthing to remember, that letter a and to look at it again in \\na month—how shall I look at it then? What shall I be feel-\\ning and thinking then? … How trivial it all must be, what \\nI am fretting about now! Of course it must all be interest-\\ning … in its way … (Ha-ha-ha! What am I thinking about?) \\nCrime and Punishment\\n734\\nI am becoming a baby, I am showing off to myself; why am I \\nashamed? Foo! how people shove! that fat man—a German \\nhe must be—who pushed against me, does he know whom \\nhe pushed? There’s a peasant woman with a baby, begging. \\nIt’s curious that she thinks me happier than she is. I might \\ngive her something, for the incongruity of it. Here’s a five \\ncopeck piece left in my pocket, where did I get it? Here, here \\n… take it, my good woman!’\\n‘God bless you,’ the beggar chanted in a lachrymose \\nvoice.\\nHe went into the Hay Market. It was distasteful, very dis-\\ntasteful to be in a crowd, but he walked just where he saw \\nmost people. He would have given anything in the world to \\nbe alone; but he knew himself that he would not have re-\\nmained alone for a moment. There was a man drunk and \\ndisorderly in the crowd; he kept trying to dance and falling \\ndown. There was a ring round him. Raskolnikov squeezed \\nhis way through the crowd, stared for some minutes at \\nthe drunken man and suddenly gave a short jerky laugh. \\nA minute later he had forgotten him and did not see him, \\nthough he still stared. He moved away at last, not remem-\\nbering where he was; but when he got into the middle of the \\nsquare an emotion suddenly came over him, overwhelming \\nhim body and mind.\\nHe suddenly recalled Sonia’s words, ‘Go to the cross-\\nroads, bow down to the people, kiss the earth, for you have \\nsinned against it too, and say aloud to the whole world, ‘I \\nam a murderer.’’ He trembled, remembering that. And \\nthe hopeless misery and anxiety of all that time, especial-\\n735\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nly of the last hours, had weighed so heavily upon him that \\nhe positively clutched at the chance of this new unmixed, \\ncomplete sensation. It came over him like a fit; it was like a \\nsingle spark kindled in his soul and spreading fire through \\nhim. Everything in him softened at once and the tears start-\\ned into his eyes. He fell to the earth on the spot….\\nHe knelt down in the middle of the square, bowed down \\nto the earth, and kissed that filthy earth with bliss and rap-\\nture. He got up and bowed down a second time.\\n‘He’s boozed,’ a youth near him observed.\\nThere was a roar of laughter.\\n‘He’s going to Jerusalem, brothers, and saying good-bye \\nto his children and his country. He’s bowing down to all \\nthe world and kissing the great city of St. Petersburg and its \\npavement,’ added a workman who was a little drunk.\\n‘Quite a young man, too!’ observed a third.\\n‘And a gentleman,’ someone observed soberly.\\n‘There’s no knowing who’s a gentleman and who isn’t \\nnowadays.’\\nThese exclamations and remarks checked Raskolnikov, \\nand the words, ‘I am a murderer,’ which were perhaps on \\nthe point of dropping from his lips, died away. He bore \\nthese remarks quietly, however, and, without looking \\nround, he turned down a street leading to the police office. \\nHe had a glimpse of something on the way which did not \\nsurprise him; he had felt that it must be so. The second time \\nhe bowed down in the Hay Market he saw, standing fifty \\npaces from him on the left, Sonia. She was hiding from him \\nbehind one of the wooden shanties in the market-place. She \\nCrime and Punishment\\n736\\nhad followed him then on his painful way! Raskolnikov at \\nthat moment felt and knew once for all that Sonia was with \\nhim for ever and would follow him to the ends of the earth, \\nwherever fate might take him. It wrung his heart … but he \\nwas just reaching the fatal place.\\nHe went into the yard fairly resolutely. He had to mount \\nto the third storey. ‘I shall be some time going up,’ he \\nthought. He felt as though the fateful moment was still far \\noff, as though he had plenty of time left for consideration.\\nAgain the same rubbish, the same eggshells lying about \\non the spiral stairs, again the open doors of the flats, again \\nthe same kitchens and the same fumes and stench coming \\nfrom them. Raskolnikov had not been here since that day. \\nHis legs were numb and gave way under him, but still they \\nmoved forward. He stopped for a moment to take breath, \\nto collect himself, so as to enter like a man. ‘But why? what \\nfor?’ he wondered, reflecting. ‘If I must drink the cup what \\ndifference does it make? The more revolting the better.’ He \\nimagined for an instant the figure of the ‘explosive lieuten-\\nant,’ Ilya Petrovitch. Was he actually going to him? Couldn’t \\nhe go to someone else? To Nikodim Fomitch? Couldn’t he \\nturn back and go straight to Nikodim Fomitch’s lodgings? \\nAt least then it would be done privately…. No, no! To the ‘ex-\\nplosive lieutenant’! If he must drink it, drink it off at once.\\nTurning cold and hardly conscious, he opened the door \\nof the office. There were very few people in it this time—\\nonly a house porter and a peasant. The doorkeeper did not \\neven peep out from behind his screen. Raskolnikov walked \\ninto the next room. ‘Perhaps I still need not speak,’ passed \\n737\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nthrough his mind. Some sort of clerk not wearing a uniform \\nwas settling himself at a bureau to write. In a corner anoth-\\ner clerk was seating himself. Zametov was not there, nor, of \\ncourse, Nikodim Fomitch.\\n‘No one in?’ Raskolnikov asked, addressing the person \\nat the bureau.\\n‘Whom do you want?’\\n‘A-ah! Not a sound was heard, not a sight was seen, but \\nI scent the Russian … how does it go on in the fairy tale … \\nI’ve forgotten! ‘At your service!’’ a familiar voice cried sud-\\ndenly.\\nRaskolnikov shuddered. The Explosive Lieutenant stood \\nbefore him. He had just come in from the third room. ‘It is \\nthe hand of fate,’ thought Raskolnikov. ‘Why is he here?’\\n‘You’ve come to see us? What about?’ cried Ilya Petro-\\nvitch. He was obviously in an exceedingly good humour \\nand perhaps a trifle exhilarated. ‘If it’s on business you are \\nrather early.[*] It’s only a chance that I am here … however \\nI’ll do what I can. I must admit, I … what is it, what is it? \\nExcuse me….’\\n[*] Dostoevsky appears to have forgotten that it is after \\nsunset, and that the last time Raskolnikov visited the police \\noffice at two in the afternoon he was reproached for coming \\ntoo late.—TRANSLATOR.\\n‘Raskolnikov.’\\n‘Of course, Raskolnikov. You didn’t imagine I’d forgotten? \\nDon’t think I am like that … Rodion Ro—Ro—Rodiono-\\nvitch, that’s it, isn’t it?’\\n‘Rodion Romanovitch.’\\nCrime and Punishment\\n738\\n‘Yes, yes, of course, Rodion Romanovitch! I was just get-\\nting at it. I made many inquiries about you. I assure you I’ve \\nbeen genuinely grieved since that … since I behaved like \\nthat … it was explained to me afterwards that you were a \\nliterary man … and a learned one too … and so to say the \\nfirst steps … Mercy on us! What literary or scientific man \\ndoes not begin by some originality of conduct! My wife and \\nI have the greatest respect for literature, in my wife it’s a \\ngenuine passion! Literature and art! If only a man is a gen-\\ntleman, all the rest can be gained by talents, learning, good \\nsense, genius. As for a hat—well, what does a hat matter? I \\ncan buy a hat as easily as I can a bun; but what’s under the \\nhat, what the hat covers, I can’t buy that! I was even mean-\\ning to come and apologise to you, but thought maybe you’d \\n… But I am forgetting to ask you, is there anything you want \\nreally? I hear your family have come?’\\n‘Yes, my mother and sister.’\\n‘I’ve even had the honour and happiness of meeting your \\nsister—a highly cultivated and charming person. I confess \\nI was sorry I got so hot with you. There it is! But as for my \\nlooking suspiciously at your fainting fit—that affair has \\nbeen cleared up splendidly! Bigotry and fanaticism! I un-\\nderstand your indignation. Perhaps you are changing your \\nlodging on account of your family’s arriving?’\\n‘No, I only looked in … I came to ask … I thought that I \\nshould find Zametov here.’\\n‘Oh, yes! Of course, you’ve made friends, I heard. Well, \\nno, Zametov is not here. Yes, we’ve lost Zametov. He’s not \\nbeen here since yesterday … he quarrelled with everyone on \\n739\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nleaving … in the rudest way. He is a feather-headed young-\\nster, that’s all; one might have expected something from \\nhim, but there, you know what they are, our brilliant young \\nmen. He wanted to go in for some examination, but it’s only \\nto talk and boast about it, it will go no further than that. Of \\ncourse it’s a very different matter with you or Mr. Razumi-\\nhin there, your friend. Your career is an intellectual one and \\nyou won’t be deterred by failure. For you, one may say, all \\nthe attractions of life nihil est—you are an ascetic, a monk, \\na hermit! … A book, a pen behind your ear, a learned re-\\nsearch—that’s where your spirit soars! I am the same way \\nmyself…. Have you read Livingstone’s Travels?’\\n‘No.’\\n‘Oh, I have. There are a great many Nihilists about nowa-\\ndays, you know, and indeed it is not to be wondered at. What \\nsort of days are they? I ask you. But we thought … you are \\nnot a Nihilist of course? Answer me openly, openly!’\\n‘N-no …’\\n‘Believe me, you can speak openly to me as you would to \\nyourself! Official duty is one thing but … you are thinking I \\nmeant to say friendship is quite another? No, you’re wrong! \\nIt’s not friendship, but the feeling of a man and a citizen, the \\nfeeling of humanity and of love for the Almighty. I may be \\nan official, but I am always bound to feel myself a man and \\na citizen…. You were asking about Zametov. Zametov will \\nmake a scandal in the French style in a house of bad reputa-\\ntion, over a glass of champagne … that’s all your Zametov \\nis good for! While I’m perhaps, so to speak, burning with \\ndevotion and lofty feelings, and besides I have rank, conse-\\nCrime and Punishment\\n740\\nquence, a post! I am married and have children, I fulfil the \\nduties of a man and a citizen, but who is he, may I ask? I ap-\\npeal to you as a man ennobled by education … Then these \\nmidwives, too, have become extraordinarily numerous.’\\nRaskolnikov raised his eyebrows inquiringly. The words \\nof Ilya Petrovitch, who had obviously been dining, were for \\nthe most part a stream of empty sounds for him. But some \\nof them he understood. He looked at him inquiringly, not \\nknowing how it would end.\\n‘I mean those crop-headed wenches,’ the talkative Ilya \\nPetrovitch continued. ‘Midwives is my name for them. I \\nthink it a very satisfactory one, ha-ha! They go to the Acad-\\nemy, study anatomy. If I fall ill, am I to send for a young \\nlady to treat me? What do you say? Ha-ha!’ Ilya Petrovitch \\nlaughed, quite pleased with his own wit. ‘It’s an immoderate \\nzeal for education, but once you’re educated, that’s enough. \\nWhy abuse it? Why insult honourable people, as that scoun-\\ndrel Zametov does? Why did he insult me, I ask you? Look \\nat these suicides, too, how common they are, you can’t fan-\\ncy! People spend their last halfpenny and kill themselves, \\nboys and girls and old people. Only this morning we heard \\nabout a gentleman who had just come to town. Nil Pavlitch, \\nI say, what was the name of that gentleman who shot him-\\nself?’\\n‘Svidrigaïlov,’ someone answered from the other room \\nwith drowsy listlessness.\\nRaskolnikov started.\\n‘Svidrigaïlov! Svidrigaïlov has shot himself!’ he cried.\\n‘What, do you know Svidrigaïlov?’\\n741\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\n‘Yes … I knew him…. He hadn’t been here long.’\\n‘Yes, that’s so. He had lost his wife, was a man of reckless \\nhabits and all of a sudden shot himself, and in such a shock-\\ning way…. He left in his notebook a few words: that he dies \\nin full possession of his faculties and that no one is to blame \\nfor his death. He had money, they say. How did you come \\nto know him?’\\n‘I … was acquainted … my sister was governess in his \\nfamily.’\\n‘Bah-bah-bah! Then no doubt you can tell us something \\nabout him. You had no suspicion?’\\n‘I saw him yesterday … he … was drinking wine; I knew \\nnothing.’\\nRaskolnikov felt as though something had fallen on him \\nand was stifling him.\\n‘You’ve turned pale again. It’s so stuffy here …’\\n‘Yes, I must go,’ muttered Raskolnikov. ‘Excuse my trou-\\nbling you….’\\n‘Oh, not at all, as often as you like. It’s a pleasure to see \\nyou and I am glad to say so.’\\nIlya Petrovitch held out his hand.\\n‘I only wanted … I came to see Zametov.’\\n‘I understand, I understand, and it’s a pleasure to see \\nyou.’\\n‘I … am very glad … good-bye,’ Raskolnikov smiled.\\nHe went out; he reeled, he was overtaken with giddiness \\nand did not know what he was doing. He began going down \\nthe stairs, supporting himself with his right hand against \\nthe wall. He fancied that a porter pushed past him on his \\nCrime and Punishment\\n742\\nway upstairs to the police office, that a dog in the lower \\nstorey kept up a shrill barking and that a woman flung a \\nrolling-pin at it and shouted. He went down and out into \\nthe yard. There, not far from the entrance, stood Sonia, pale \\nand horror- stricken. She looked wildly at him. He stood \\nstill before her. There was a look of poignant agony, of de-\\nspair, in her face. She clasped her hands. His lips worked in \\nan ugly, meaningless smile. He stood still a minute, grinned \\nand went back to the police office.\\nIlya Petrovitch had sat down and was rummaging among \\nsome papers. Before him stood the same peasant who had \\npushed by on the stairs.\\n‘Hulloa! Back again! have you left something behind? \\nWhat’s the matter?’\\nRaskolnikov, with white lips and staring eyes, came \\nslowly nearer. He walked right to the table, leaned his hand \\non it, tried to say something, but could not; only incoherent \\nsounds were audible.\\n‘You are feeling ill, a chair! Here, sit down! Some water!’\\nRaskolnikov dropped on to a chair, but he kept his eyes \\nfixed on the face of Ilya Petrovitch, which expressed un-\\npleasant surprise. Both looked at one another for a minute \\nand waited. Water was brought.\\n‘It was I …’ began Raskolnikov.\\n‘Drink some water.’\\nRaskolnikov refused the water with his hand, and softly \\nand brokenly, but distinctly said:\\n‘It was I killed the old pawnbroker woman and her sister \\nLizaveta with an axe and robbed them.’\\n743\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nIlya Petrovitch opened his mouth. People ran up on all \\nsides.\\nRaskolnikov repeated his statement.\\nCrime and Punishment\\n744\\n'"

       "'\\nO\\nn an exceptionally hot evening early in July a young \\nman came out of the garret in which he lodged in S. \\nPlace and walked slowly, as though in hesitation, towards \\nK. bridge.\\nHe had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the \\nstaircase. His garret was under the roof of a high, five-sto-\\nried house and was more like a cupboard than a room. The \\nlandlady who provided him with garret, dinners, and at-\\ntendance, lived on the floor below, and every time he went \\nout he was obliged to pass her kitchen, the door of which \\ninvariably stood open. And each time he passed, the young \\nman had a sick, frightened feeling, which made him scowl \\nand feel ashamed. He was hopelessly in debt to his landlady, \\nand was afraid of meeting her.\\nThis was not because he was cowardly and abject, quite \\nthe contrary; but for some time past he had been in an over-\\nstrained irritable condition, verging on hypochondria. He \\nhad become so completely absorbed in himself, and iso-\\nlated from his fellows that he dreaded meeting, not only \\nhis landlady, but anyone at all. He was crushed by poverty, \\nbut the anxieties of his position had of late ceased to weigh \\nupon him.

Yes, maybe \\nit is a plaything.’\\nThe heat in the street was terrible: and the airlessness, the \\nbustle and the plaster, scaffolding, bricks, and dust all about \\nhim, and that special Petersburg stench, so familiar to all \\nwho are unable to get out of town in summer—all worked \\npainfully upon the young man’s already overwrought \\nnerves. The insufferable stench from the pot- houses, which \\nare particularly numerous in that part of the town, and the \\ndrunken men whom he met continually, although it was a \\nworking day, completed the revolting misery of the picture. \\n\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nAn expression of the profoundest disgust gleamed for a mo-\\nment in the young man’s refined face. He was, by the way, \\nexceptionally handsome, above the average in height, slim, \\nwell-built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair. \\nSoon he sank into deep thought, or more accurately speak-\\ning into a complete blankness of mind; he walked along not \\nobserving what was about him and not caring to observe it. \\nFrom time to time, he would mutter something, from the \\nhabit of talking to himself, to which he had just confessed. \\nAt these moments he would become conscious that his ideas \\nwere sometimes in a tangle and that he was very weak; for \\ntwo days he had scarcely tasted food.\\nHe was so badly dressed that even a man accustomed to \\nshabbiness would have been ashamed to be seen in the street \\nin such rags. In that quarter of the town, however, scarce-\\nly any shortcoming in dress would have created surprise. \\nOwing to the proximity of the Hay Market, the number of \\nestablishments of bad character, the preponderance of the \\ntrading and working class population crowded in these \\nstreets and alleys in the heart of Petersburg, types so vari-\\nous were to be seen in the streets that no figure, however \\nqueer, would have caused surprise. But there was such accu-\\nmulated bitterness and contempt in the young man’s heart, \\nthat, in spite of all the fastidiousness of youth, he minded \\nhis rags least of all in the street. It was a different matter \\nwhen he met with acquaintances or with former fellow stu-\\ndents, whom, indeed, he disliked meeting at any time. And \\nyet when a drunken man who, for some unknown reason, \\nwas being taken somewhere in a huge waggon dragged by a \\nCrime and Punishment\\n10\\nheavy dray horse, suddenly shouted at him as he drove past: \\n‘Hey there, German hatter’ bawling at the top of his voice \\nand pointing at him—the young man stopped suddenly \\nand clutched tremulously at his hat. It was a tall round hat \\nfrom Zimmerman’s, but completely worn out, rusty with \\nage, all torn and bespattered, brimless and bent on one side \\nin a most unseemly fashion. Not shame, however, but quite \\nanother feeling akin to terror had overtaken him.\\n‘I knew it,’ he muttered in confusion, ‘I thought so! That’s \\nthe worst of all! Why, a stupid thing like this, the most trivial \\ndetail might spoil the whole plan. Yes, my hat is too notice-\\nable…. It looks absurd and that makes it noticeable…. With \\nmy rags I ought to wear a cap, any sort of old pancake, but \\nnot this grotesque thing. Nobody wears such a hat, it would \\nbe noticed a mile off, it would be remembered…. What mat-\\nters is that people would remember it, and that would give \\nthem a clue. For this business one should be as little con-\\nspicuous as possible…. Trifles, trifles are what matter! Why, \\nit’s just such trifles that always ruin everything….’\\nHe had not far to go; he knew indeed how many steps \\nit was from the gate of his lodging house: exactly seven \\nhundred and thirty. He had counted them once when he \\nhad been lost in dreams. At the time he had put no faith \\nin those dreams and was only tantalising himself by their \\nhideous but daring recklessness. Now, a month later, he had \\nbegun to look upon them differently, and, in spite of the \\nmonologues in which he jeered at his own impotence and \\nindecision, he had involuntarily come to regard this ‘hid-\\neous’ dream as an exploit to be attempted, although he still \\n11\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\ndid not realise this himself. He was positively going now for \\na ‘rehearsal’ of his project, and at every step his excitement \\ngrew more and more violent.\\nWith a sinking heart and a nervous tremor, he went up \\nto a huge house which on one side looked on to the canal, \\nand on the other into the street. This house was let out in \\ntiny tenements and was inhabited by working people of all \\nkinds—tailors, locksmiths, cooks, Germans of sorts, girls \\npicking up a living as best they could, petty clerks, etc. There \\nwas a continual coming and going through the two gates \\nand in the two courtyards of the house. Three or four door-\\nkeepers were employed on the building. The young man \\nwas very glad to meet none of them, and at once slipped un-\\nnoticed through the door on the right, and up the staircase. \\nIt was a back staircase, dark and narrow, but he was familiar \\nwith it already, and knew his way, and he liked all these sur-\\nroundings: in such darkness even the most inquisitive eyes \\nwere not to be dreaded.\\n‘If I am so scared now, what would it be if it somehow \\ncame to pass that I were really going to do it?’ he could not \\nhelp asking himself as he reached the fourth storey. There \\nhis progress was barred by some porters who were engaged \\nin moving furniture out of a flat. He knew that the flat had \\nbeen occupied by a German clerk in the civil service, and \\nhis family. This German was moving out then, and so the \\nfourth floor on this staircase would be untenanted except by \\nthe old woman. ‘That’s a good thing anyway,’ he thought to \\nhimself, as he rang the bell of the old woman’s flat. The bell \\ngave a faint tinkle as though it were made of tin and not of \\nCrime and Punishment\\n12\\ncopper. The little flats in such houses always have bells that \\nring like that. He had forgotten the note of that bell, and \\nnow its peculiar tinkle seemed to remind him of something \\nand to bring it clearly before him…. He started, his nerves \\nwere terribly overstrained by now. In a little while, the door \\nwas opened a tiny crack: the old woman eyed her visitor \\nwith evident distrust through the crack, and nothing could \\nbe seen but her little eyes, glittering in the darkness. But, \\nseeing a number of people on the landing, she grew bolder, \\nand opened the door wide. The young man stepped into the \\ndark entry, which was partitioned off from the tiny kitch-\\nen. The old woman stood facing him in silence and looking \\ninquiringly at him. She was a diminutive, withered up old \\nwoman of sixty, with sharp malignant eyes and a sharp lit-\\ntle nose. Her colourless, somewhat grizzled hair was thickly \\nsmeared with oil, and she wore no kerchief over it. Round \\nher thin long neck, which looked like a hen’s leg, was knot-\\nted some sort of flannel rag, and, in spite of the heat, there \\nhung flapping on her shoulders, a mangy fur cape, yellow \\nwith age. The old woman coughed and groaned at every in-\\nstant. The young man must have looked at her with a rather \\npeculiar expression, for a gleam of mistrust came into her \\neyes again.\\n‘Raskolnikov, a student, I came here a month ago,’ the \\nyoung man made haste to mutter, with a half bow, remem-\\nbering that he ought to be more polite.\\n‘I remember, my good sir, I remember quite well your \\ncoming here,’ the old woman said distinctly, still keeping \\nher inquiring eyes on his face.\\n13\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\n‘And here … I am again on the same errand,’ Raskol-\\nnikov continued, a little disconcerted and surprised at \\nthe old woman’s mistrust. ‘Perhaps she is always like that \\nthough, only I did not notice it the other time,’ he thought \\nwith an uneasy feeling.\\nThe old woman paused, as though hesitating; then \\nstepped on one side, and pointing to the door of the room, \\nshe said, letting her visitor pass in front of her:\\n‘Step in, my good sir.’\\nThe little room into which the young man walked, with \\nyellow paper on the walls, geraniums and muslin curtains \\nin the windows, was brightly lighted up at that moment by \\nthe setting sun.\\n‘So the sun will shine like this then too!’ flashed as it were \\nby chance through Raskolnikov’s mind, and with a rapid \\nglance he scanned everything in the room, trying as far as \\npossible to notice and remember its arrangement. But there \\nwas nothing special in the room. The furniture, all very old \\nand of yellow wood, consisted of a sofa with a huge bent \\nwooden back, an oval table in front of the sofa, a dressing-\\ntable with a looking-glass fixed on it between the windows, \\nchairs along the walls and two or three half-penny prints in \\nyellow frames, representing German damsels with birds in \\ntheir hands—that was all. In the corner a light was burning \\nbefore a small ikon. Everything was very clean; the floor and \\nthe furniture were brightly polished; everything shone.\\n‘Lizaveta’s work,’ thought the young man. There was not \\na speck of dust to be seen in the whole flat.\\n‘It’s in the houses of spiteful old widows that one finds \\nCrime and Punishment\\n14\\nsuch cleanliness,’ Raskolnikov thought again, and he stole \\na curious glance at the cotton curtain over the door leading \\ninto another tiny room, in which stood the old woman’s bed \\nand chest of drawers and into which he had never looked \\nbefore. These two rooms made up the whole flat.\\n‘What do you want?’ the old woman said severely, com-\\ning into the room and, as before, standing in front of him so \\nas to look him straight in the face.\\n‘I’ve brought something to pawn here,’ and he drew out \\nof his pocket an old-fashioned flat silver watch, on the back \\nof which was engraved a globe; the chain was of steel.\\n‘But the time is up for your last pledge. The month was up \\nthe day before yesterday.’\\n‘I will bring you the interest for another month; wait a \\nlittle.’\\n‘But that’s for me to do as I please, my good sir, to wait or \\nto sell your pledge at once.’\\n‘How much will you give me for the watch, Alyona Iva-\\nnovna?’\\n‘You come with such trifles, my good sir, it’s scarcely \\nworth anything. I gave you two roubles last time for your \\nring and one could buy it quite new at a jeweler’s for a rou-\\nble and a half.’\\n‘Give me four roubles for it, I shall redeem it, it was my \\nfather’s. I shall be getting some money soon.’\\n‘A rouble and a half, and interest in advance, if you like!’\\n‘A rouble and a half!’ cried the young man.\\n‘Please yourself’—and the old woman handed him back \\nthe watch. The young man took it, and was so angry that he \\n15\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nwas on the point of going away; but checked himself at once, \\nremembering that there was nowhere else he could go, and \\nthat he had had another object also in coming.\\n‘Hand it over,’ he said roughly.\\nThe old woman fumbled in her pocket for her keys, and \\ndisappeared behind the curtain into the other room. The \\nyoung man, left standing alone in the middle of the room, \\nlistened inquisitively, thinking. He could hear her unlock-\\ning the chest of drawers.\\n‘It must be the top drawer,’ he reflected. ‘So she carries \\nthe keys in a pocket on the right. All in one bunch on a steel \\nring…. And there’s one key there, three times as big as all \\nthe others, with deep notches; that can’t be the key of the \\nchest of drawers … then there must be some other chest or \\nstrong-box … that’s worth knowing. Strong-boxes always \\nhave keys like that … but how degrading it all is.’\\nThe old woman came back.\\n‘Here, sir: as we say ten copecks the rouble a month, so \\nI must take fifteen copecks from a rouble and a half for the \\nmonth in advance. But for the two roubles I lent you before, \\nyou owe me now twenty copecks on the same reckoning \\nin advance. That makes thirty-five copecks altogether. So \\nI must give you a rouble and fifteen copecks for the watch. \\nHere it is.’\\n‘What! only a rouble and fifteen copecks now!’\\n‘Just so.’\\nThe young man did not dispute it and took the money. \\nHe looked at the old woman, and was in no hurry to get \\naway, as though there was still something he wanted to say \\nCrime and Punishment\\n16\\nor to do, but he did not himself quite know what.\\n‘I may be bringing you something else in a day or two, \\nAlyona Ivanovna —a valuable thing—silver—a cigarette-\\nbox, as soon as I get it back from a friend …’ he broke off in \\nconfusion.\\n‘Well, we will talk about it then, sir.’\\n‘Good-bye—are you always at home alone, your sister is \\nnot here with you?’ He asked her as casually as possible as \\nhe went out into the passage.\\n‘What business is she of yours, my good sir?’\\n‘Oh, nothing particular, I simply asked. You are too \\nquick…. Good-day, Alyona Ivanovna.’\\nRaskolnikov went out in complete confusion. This con-\\nfusion became more and more intense. As he went down the \\nstairs, he even stopped short, two or three times, as though \\nsuddenly struck by some thought. When he was in the street \\nhe cried out, ‘Oh, God, how loathsome it all is! and can I, \\ncan I possibly…. No, it’s nonsense, it’s rubbish!’ he added \\nresolutely. ‘And how could such an atrocious thing come \\ninto my head? What filthy things my heart is capable of. Yes, \\nfilthy above all, disgusting, loathsome, loathsome!—and for \\na whole month I’ve been….’ But no words, no exclamations, \\ncould express his agitation. The feeling of intense repulsion, \\nwhich had begun to oppress and torture his heart while he \\nwas on his way to the old woman, had by now reached such \\na pitch and had taken such a definite form that he did not \\nknow what to do with himself to escape from his wretched-\\nness. He walked along the pavement like a drunken man, \\nregardless of the passers-by, and jostling against them, and \\n17\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nonly came to his senses when he was in the next street. Look-\\ning round, he noticed that he was standing close to a tavern \\nwhich was entered by steps leading from the pavement to \\nthe basement. At that instant two drunken men came out \\nat the door, and abusing and supporting one another, they \\nmounted the steps. Without stopping to think, Raskolnikov \\nwent down the steps at once. Till that moment he had never \\nbeen into a tavern, but now he felt giddy and was tormented \\nby a burning thirst. He longed for a drink of cold beer, and \\nattributed his sudden weakness to the want of food. He sat \\ndown at a sticky little table in a dark and dirty corner; or-\\ndered some beer, and eagerly drank off the first glassful. At \\nonce he felt easier; and his thoughts became clear.\\n‘All that’s nonsense,’ he said hopefully, ‘and there is noth-\\ning in it all to worry about! It’s simply physical derangement. \\nJust a glass of beer, a piece of dry bread—and in one mo-\\nment the brain is stronger, the mind is clearer and the will \\nis firm! Phew, how utterly petty it all is!’\\nBut in spite of this scornful reflection, he was by now \\nlooking cheerful as though he were suddenly set free from \\na terrible burden: and he gazed round in a friendly way at \\nthe people in the room. But even at that moment he had a \\ndim foreboding that this happier frame of mind was also \\nnot normal.\\nThere were few people at the time in the tavern. Besides \\nthe two drunken men he had met on the steps, a group con-\\nsisting of about five men and a girl with a concertina had \\ngone out at the same time. Their departure left the room \\nquiet and rather empty. The persons still in the tavern were \\nCrime and Punishment\\n18\\na man who appeared to be an artisan, drunk, but not ex-\\ntremely so, sitting before a pot of beer, and his companion, \\na huge, stout man with a grey beard, in a short full-skirted \\ncoat. He was very drunk: and had dropped asleep on the \\nbench; every now and then, he began as though in his sleep, \\ncracking his fingers, with his arms wide apart and the up-\\nper part of his body bounding about on the bench, while he \\nhummed some meaningless refrain, trying to recall some \\nsuch lines as these:\\n‘His wife a year he fondly loved His wife a—a year he—\\nfondly loved.’\\nOr suddenly waking up again:\\n‘Walking along the crowded row He met the one he used \\nto know.’\\nBut no one shared his enjoyment: his silent compan-\\nion looked with positive hostility and mistrust at all these \\nmanifestations. There was another man in the room who \\nlooked somewhat like a retired government clerk. He was \\nsitting apart, now and then sipping from his pot and look-\\ning round at the company. He, too, appeared to be in some \\nagitation.\\n19\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\n'"

       "['\\nO\\nn an exceptionally hot evening early in July a young \\nman came out of the garret in which he lodged in S. \\nPlace and walked slowly, as though in hesitation, towards \\nK. bridge.\\nHe had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the \\nstaircase. His garret was under the roof of a high, five-sto-\\nried house and was more like a cupboard than a room. The \\nlandlady who provided him with garret, dinners, and at-\\ntendance, lived on the floor below, and every time he went \\nout he was obliged to pass her kitchen, the door of which \\ninvariably stood open. And each time he passed, the young \\nman had a sick, frightened feeling, which made him scowl \\nand feel ashamed. He was hopelessly in debt to his landlady, \\nand was afraid of meeting her.\\nThis was not because he was cowardly and abject, quite \\nthe contrary; but for some time past he had been in an over-\\nstrained irritable condition, verging on hypochondria. He \\nhad become so completely absorbed in himself, and iso-\\nlated from his fellows that he dreaded meeting, not only \\nhis landlady, but anyone at all.

There was not \\na speck of dust to be seen in the whole flat.\\n‘It’s in the houses of spiteful old widows that one finds \\nCrime and Punishment\\n14\\nsuch cleanliness,’ Raskolnikov thought again, and he stole \\na curious glance at the cotton curtain over the door leading \\ninto another tiny room, in which stood the old woman’s bed \\nand chest of drawers and into which he had never looked \\nbefore. These two rooms made up the whole flat.\\n‘What do you want?’ the old woman said severely, com-\\ning into the room and, as before, standing in front of him so \\nas to look him straight in the face.\\n‘I’ve brought something to pawn here,’ and he drew out \\nof his pocket an old-fashioned flat silver watch, on the back \\nof which was engraved a globe; the chain was of steel.\\n‘But the time is up for your last pledge. The month was up \\nthe day before yesterday.’\\n‘I will bring you the interest for another month; wait a \\nlittle.’\\n‘But that’s for me to do as I please, my good sir, to wait or \\nto sell your pledge at once.’\\n‘How much will you give me for the watch, Alyona Iva-\\nnovna?’\\n‘You come with such trifles, my good sir, it’s scarcely \\nworth anything. I gave you two roubles last time for your \\nring and one could buy it quite new at a jeweler’s for a rou-\\nble and a half.’\\n‘Give me four roubles for it, I shall redeem it, it was my \\nfather’s. I shall be getting some money soon.’\\n‘A rouble and a half, and interest in advance, if you like!’\\n‘A rouble and a half!’ cried the young man.\\n‘Please yourself’—and the old woman handed him back \\nthe watch. The young man took it, and was so angry that he \\n15\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nwas on the point of going away; but checked himself at once, \\nremembering that there was nowhere else he could go, and \\nthat he had had another object also in coming.\\n‘Hand it over,’ he said roughly.\\nThe old woman fumbled in her pocket for her keys, and \\ndisappeared behind the curtain into the other room. The \\nyoung man, left standing alone in the middle of the room, \\nlistened inquisitively, thinking. He could hear her unlock-\\ning the chest of drawers.\\n‘It must be the top drawer,’ he reflected. ‘So she carries \\nthe keys in a pocket on the right. All in one bunch on a steel \\nring…. And there’s one key there, three times as big as all \\nthe others, with deep notches; that can’t be the key of the \\nchest of drawers … then there must be some other chest or \\nstrong-box … that’s worth knowing. Strong-boxes always \\nhave keys like that … but how degrading it all is.’\\nThe old woman came back.\\n‘Here, sir: as we say ten copecks the rouble a month, so \\nI must take fifteen copecks from a rouble and a half for the \\nmonth in advance. But for the two roubles I lent you before, \\nyou owe me now twenty copecks on the same reckoning \\nin advance. That makes thirty-five copecks altogether. So \\nI must give you a rouble and fifteen copecks for the watch. \\nHere it is.’\\n‘What! only a rouble and fifteen copecks now!’\\n‘Just so.’\\nThe young man did not dispute it and took the money. \\nHe looked at the old woman, and was in no hurry to get \\naway, as though there was still something he wanted to say \\nCrime and Punishment\\n16\\nor to do, but he did not himself quite know what.\\n‘I may be bringing you something else in a day or two, \\nAlyona Ivanovna —a valuable thing—silver—a cigarette-\\nbox, as soon as I get it back from a friend …’ he broke off in \\nconfusion.\\n‘Well, we will talk about it then, sir.’\\n‘Good-bye—are you always at home alone, your sister is \\nnot here with you?’ He asked her as casually as possible as \\nhe went out into the passage.\\n‘What business is she of yours, my good sir?’\\n‘Oh, nothing particular, I simply asked. You are too \\nquick…. Good-day, Alyona Ivanovna.’\\nRaskolnikov went out in complete confusion. This con-\\nfusion became more and more intense. As he went down the \\nstairs, he even stopped short, two or three times, as though \\nsuddenly struck by some thought. When he was in the street \\nhe cried out, ‘Oh, God, how loathsome it all is! and can I, \\ncan I possibly…. No, it’s nonsense, it’s rubbish!’ he added \\nresolutely. ‘And how could such an atrocious thing come \\ninto my head? What filthy things my heart is capable of. Yes, \\nfilthy above all, disgusting, loathsome, loathsome!—and for \\na whole month I’ve been….’ But no words, no exclamations, \\ncould express his agitation. The feeling of intense repulsion, \\nwhich had begun to oppress and torture his heart while he \\nwas on his way to the old woman, had by now reached such \\na pitch and had taken such a definite form that he did not \\nknow what to do with himself to escape from his wretched-\\nness. He walked along the pavement like a drunken man, \\nregardless of the passers-by, and jostling against them, and \\n17\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nonly came to his senses when he was in the next street. Look-\\ning round, he noticed that he was standing close to a tavern \\nwhich was entered by steps leading from the pavement to \\nthe basement. At that instant two drunken men came out \\nat the door, and abusing and supporting one another, they \\nmounted the steps. Without stopping to think, Raskolnikov \\nwent down the steps at once. Till that moment he had never \\nbeen into a tavern, but now he felt giddy and was tormented \\nby a burning thirst. He longed for a drink of cold beer, and \\nattributed his sudden weakness to the want of food. He sat \\ndown at a sticky little table in a dark and dirty corner; or-\\ndered some beer, and eagerly drank off the first glassful. At \\nonce he felt easier; and his thoughts became clear.\\n‘All that’s nonsense,’ he said hopefully, ‘and there is noth-\\ning in it all to worry about! It’s simply physical derangement. \\nJust a glass of beer, a piece of dry bread—and in one mo-\\nment the brain is stronger, the mind is clearer and the will \\nis firm! Phew, how utterly petty it all is!’\\nBut in spite of this scornful reflection, he was by now \\nlooking cheerful as though he were suddenly set free from \\na terrible burden: and he gazed round in a friendly way at \\nthe people in the room. But even at that moment he had a \\ndim foreboding that this happier frame of mind was also \\nnot normal.\\nThere were few people at the time in the tavern. Besides \\nthe two drunken men he had met on the steps, a group con-\\nsisting of about five men and a girl with a concertina had \\ngone out at the same time. Their departure left the room \\nquiet and rather empty. The persons still in the tavern were \\nCrime and Punishment\\n18\\na man who appeared to be an artisan, drunk, but not ex-\\ntremely so, sitting before a pot of beer, and his companion, \\na huge, stout man with a grey beard, in a short full-skirted \\ncoat. He was very drunk: and had dropped asleep on the \\nbench; every now and then, he began as though in his sleep, \\ncracking his fingers, with his arms wide apart and the up-\\nper part of his body bounding about on the bench, while he \\nhummed some meaningless refrain, trying to recall some \\nsuch lines as these:\\n‘His wife a year he fondly loved His wife a—a year he—\\nfondly loved.’\\nOr suddenly waking up again:\\n‘Walking along the crowded row He met the one he used \\nto know.’\\nBut no one shared his enjoyment: his silent compan-\\nion looked with positive hostility and mistrust at all these \\nmanifestations. There was another man in the room who \\nlooked somewhat like a retired government clerk. He was \\nsitting apart, now and then sipping from his pot and look-\\ning round at the company. He, too, appeared to be in some \\nagitation.\\n19\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\n',\n",
       " '\\nR\\naskolnikov was not used to crowds, and, as we said be-\\nfore, he avoided society of every sort, more especially \\nof late. But now all at once he felt a desire to be with other \\npeople. Something new seemed to be taking place within \\nhim, and with it he felt a sort of thirst for company. He was \\nso weary after a whole month of concentrated wretchedness \\nand gloomy excitement that he longed to rest, if only for a \\nmoment, in some other world, whatever it might be; and, in \\nspite of the filthiness of the surroundings, he was glad now \\nto stay in the tavern.\\nThe master of the establishment was in another room, but \\nhe frequently came down some steps into the main room, \\nhis jaunty, tarred boots with red turn-over tops coming \\ninto view each time before the rest of his person. He wore \\na full coat and a horribly greasy black satin waistcoat, with \\nno cravat, and his whole face seemed smeared with oil like \\nan iron lock. At the counter stood a boy of about fourteen, \\nand there was another boy somewhat younger who handed \\nwhatever was wanted. On the counter lay some sliced cu-\\ncumber, some pieces of dried black bread, and some fish, \\nchopped up small, all smelling very bad. It was insufferably \\nclose, and so heavy with the fumes of spirits that five min-\\nutes in such an atmosphere might well make a man drunk.\\nThere are chance meetings with strangers that interest \\nCrime and Punishment\\n20\\nus from the first moment, before a word is spoken. Such \\nwas the impression made on Raskolnikov by the person sit-\\nting a little distance from him, who looked like a retired \\nclerk. The young man often recalled this impression af-\\nterwards, and even ascribed it to presentiment. He looked \\nrepeatedly at the clerk, partly no doubt because the latter \\nwas staring persistently at him, obviously anxious to enter \\ninto conversation. At the other persons in the room, includ-\\ning the tavern- keeper, the clerk looked as though he were \\nused to their company, and weary of it, showing a shade of \\ncondescending contempt for them as persons of station and \\nculture inferior to his own, with whom it would be useless \\nfor him to converse. He was a man over fifty, bald and griz-\\nzled, of medium height, and stoutly built. His face, bloated \\nfrom continual drinking, was of a yellow, even greenish, \\ntinge, with swollen eyelids out of which keen reddish eyes \\ngleamed like little chinks. But there was something very \\nstrange in him; there was a light in his eyes as though of \\nintense feeling—perhaps there were even thought and intel-\\nligence, but at the same time there was a gleam of something \\nlike madness. He was wearing an old and hopelessly ragged \\nblack dress coat, with all its buttons missing except one, \\nand that one he had buttoned, evidently clinging to this \\nlast trace of respectability. A crumpled shirt front, covered \\nwith spots and stains, protruded from his canvas waistcoat. \\nLike a clerk, he wore no beard, nor moustache, but had been \\nso long unshaven that his chin looked like a stiff greyish \\nbrush. And there was something respectable and like an of-\\nficial about his manner too. But he was restless; he ruffled \\n21\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nup his hair and from time to time let his head drop into his \\nhands dejectedly resting his ragged elbows on the stained \\nand sticky table. At last he looked straight at Raskolnikov, \\nand said loudly and resolutely:\\n‘May I venture, honoured sir, to engage you in polite con-\\nversation? Forasmuch as, though your exterior would not \\ncommand respect, my experience admonishes me that you \\nare a man of education and not accustomed to drinking. I \\nhave always respected education when in conjunction with \\ngenuine sentiments, and I am besides a titular counsellor in \\nrank. Marmeladov—such is my name; titular counsellor. I \\nmake bold to inquire—have you been in the service?’\\n‘No, I am studying,’ answered the young man, some-\\nwhat surprised at the grandiloquent style of the speaker \\nand also at being so directly addressed. In spite of the mo-\\nmentary desire he had just been feeling for company of any \\nsort, on being actually spoken to he felt immediately his \\nhabitual irritable and uneasy aversion for any stranger who \\napproached or attempted to approach him.\\n‘A student then, or formerly a student,’ cried the clerk. \\n‘Just what I thought! I’m a man of experience, immense ex-\\nperience, sir,’ and he tapped his forehead with his fingers \\nin self-approval. ‘You’ve been a student or have attended \\nsome learned institution! … But allow me….’ He got up, \\nstaggered, took up his jug and glass, and sat down beside \\nthe young man, facing him a little sideways. He was drunk, \\nbut spoke fluently and boldly, only occasionally losing the \\nthread of his sentences and drawling his words. He pounced \\nupon Raskolnikov as greedily as though he too had not spo-\\nCrime and Punishment\\n22\\nken to a soul for a month.\\n‘Honoured sir,’ he began almost with solemnity, ‘poverty \\nis not a vice, that’s a true saying. Yet I know too that drunk-\\nenness is not a virtue, and that that’s even truer. But beggary, \\nhonoured sir, beggary is a vice. In poverty you may still re-\\ntain your innate nobility of soul, but in beggary—never—no \\none. For beggary a man is not chased out of human society \\nwith a stick, he is swept out with a broom, so as to make it \\nas humiliating as possible; and quite right, too, forasmuch \\nas in beggary I am ready to be the first to humiliate myself. \\nHence the pot-house! Honoured sir, a month ago Mr. Le-\\nbeziatnikov gave my wife a beating, and my wife is a very \\ndifferent matter from me! Do you understand? Allow me to \\nask you another question out of simple curiosity: have you \\never spent a night on a hay barge, on the Neva?’\\n‘No, I have not happened to,’ answered Raskolnikov. \\n‘What do you mean?’\\n‘Well, I’ve just come from one and it’s the fifth night I’ve \\nslept so….’ He filled his glass, emptied it and paused. Bits of \\nhay were in fact clinging to his clothes and sticking to his \\nhair. It seemed quite probable that he had not undressed or \\nwashed for the last five days. His hands, particularly, were \\nfilthy. They were fat and red, with black nails.\\nHis conversation seemed to excite a general though lan-\\nguid interest. The boys at the counter fell to sniggering. The \\ninnkeeper came down from the upper room, apparently on \\npurpose to listen to the ‘funny fellow’ and sat down at a \\nlittle distance, yawning lazily, but with dignity. Evidently \\nMarmeladov was a familiar figure here, and he had most \\n23\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nlikely acquired his weakness for high-flown speeches from \\nthe habit of frequently entering into conversation with \\nstrangers of all sorts in the tavern. This habit develops into \\na necessity in some drunkards, and especially in those who \\nare looked after sharply and kept in order at home. Hence \\nin the company of other drinkers they try to justify them-\\nselves and even if possible obtain consideration.\\n‘Funny fellow!’ pronounced the innkeeper. ‘And why \\ndon’t you work, why aren’t you at your duty, if you are in \\nthe service?’\\n‘Why am I not at my duty, honoured sir,’ Marmeladov \\nwent on, addressing himself exclusively to Raskolnikov, as \\nthough it had been he who put that question to him. ‘Why \\nam I not at my duty? Does not my heart ache to think what \\na useless worm I am? A month ago when Mr. Lebeziatnikov \\nbeat my wife with his own hands, and I lay drunk, didn’t I \\nsuffer? Excuse me, young man, has it ever happened to you \\n… hm … well, to petition hopelessly for a loan?’\\n‘Yes, it has. But what do you mean by hopelessly?’\\n‘Hopelessly in the fullest sense, when you know before-\\nhand that you will get nothing by it. You know, for instance, \\nbeforehand with positive certainty that this man, this most \\nreputable and exemplary citizen, will on no consideration \\ngive you money; and indeed I ask you why should he? For \\nhe knows of course that I shan’t pay it back. From compas-\\nsion? But Mr. Lebeziatnikov who keeps up with modern \\nideas explained the other day that compassion is forbidden \\nnowadays by science itself, and that that’s what is done now \\nin England, where there is political economy. Why, I ask \\nCrime and Punishment\\n24\\nyou, should he give it to me? And yet though I know before-\\nhand that he won’t, I set off to him and …’\\n‘Why do you go?’ put in Raskolnikov.\\n‘Well, when one has no one, nowhere else one can go! \\nFor every man must have somewhere to go. Since there are \\ntimes when one absolutely must go somewhere! When my \\nown daughter first went out with a yellow ticket, then I had \\nto go … (for my daughter has a yellow passport),’ he add-\\ned in parenthesis, looking with a certain uneasiness at the \\nyoung man. ‘No matter, sir, no matter!’ he went on hurried-\\nly and with apparent composure when both the boys at the \\ncounter guffawed and even the innkeeper smiled—‘No mat-\\nter, I am not confounded by the wagging of their heads; for \\neveryone knows everything about it already, and all that is \\nsecret is made open. And I accept it all, not with contempt, \\nbut with humility. So be it! So be it! ‘Behold the man!’ Ex-\\ncuse me, young man, can you…. No, to put it more strongly \\nand more distinctly; not can you but dare you, looking upon \\nme, assert that I am not a pig?’\\nThe young man did not answer a word.\\n‘Well,’ the orator began again stolidly and with even in-\\ncreased dignity, after waiting for the laughter in the room \\nto subside. ‘Well, so be it, I am a pig, but she is a lady! I \\nhave the semblance of a beast, but Katerina Ivanovna, my \\nspouse, is a person of education and an officer’s daughter. \\nGranted, granted, I am a scoundrel, but she is a woman of \\na noble heart, full of sentiments, refined by education. And \\nyet … oh, if only she felt for me! Honoured sir, honoured sir, \\nyou know every man ought to have at least one place where \\n25\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\npeople feel for him! But Katerina Ivanovna, though she is \\nmagnanimous, she is unjust…. And yet, although I realise \\nthat when she pulls my hair she only does it out of pity—for \\nI repeat without being ashamed, she pulls my hair, young \\nman,’ he declared with redoubled dignity, hearing the snig-\\ngering again—‘but, my God, if she would but once…. But \\nno, no! It’s all in vain and it’s no use talking! No use talk-\\ning! For more than once, my wish did come true and more \\nthan once she has felt for me but … such is my fate and I am \\na beast by nature!’\\n‘Rather!’ assented the innkeeper yawning. Marmeladov \\nstruck his fist resolutely on the table.\\n‘Such is my fate! Do you know, sir, do you know, I have \\nsold her very stockings for drink? Not her shoes—that \\nwould be more or less in the order of things, but her stock-\\nings, her stockings I have sold for drink! Her mohair shawl \\nI sold for drink, a present to her long ago, her own property, \\nnot mine; and we live in a cold room and she caught cold \\nthis winter and has begun coughing and spitting blood too. \\nWe have three little children and Katerina Ivanovna is at \\nwork from morning till night; she is scrubbing and cleaning \\nand washing the children, for she’s been used to cleanliness \\nfrom a child. But her chest is weak and she has a tendency \\nto consumption and I feel it! Do you suppose I don’t feel it? \\nAnd the more I drink the more I feel it. That’s why I drink \\ntoo. I try to find sympathy and feeling in drink…. I drink so \\nthat I may suffer twice as much!’ And as though in despair \\nhe laid his head down on the table.\\n‘Young man,’ he went on, raising his head again, ‘in your \\nCrime and Punishment\\n26\\nface I seem to read some trouble of mind. When you came \\nin I read it, and that was why I addressed you at once. For \\nin unfolding to you the story of my life, I do not wish to \\nmake myself a laughing-stock before these idle listeners, \\nwho indeed know all about it already, but I am looking for a \\nman of feeling and education. Know then that my wife was \\neducated in a high-class school for the daughters of noble-\\nmen, and on leaving she danced the shawl dance before the \\ngovernor and other personages for which she was presented \\nwith a gold medal and a certificate of merit. The medal … \\nwell, the medal of course was sold—long ago, hm … but the \\ncertificate of merit is in her trunk still and not long ago she \\nshowed it to our landlady. And although she is most con-\\ntinually on bad terms with the landlady, yet she wanted to \\ntell someone or other of her past honours and of the happy \\ndays that are gone. I don’t condemn her for it, I don’t blame \\nher, for the one thing left her is recollection of the past, and \\nall the rest is dust and ashes. Yes, yes, she is a lady of spirit, \\nproud and determined. She scrubs the floors herself and has \\nnothing but black bread to eat, but won’t allow herself to be \\ntreated with disrespect. That’s why she would not overlook \\nMr. Lebeziatnikov’s rudeness to her, and so when he gave \\nher a beating for it, she took to her bed more from the hurt \\nto her feelings than from the blows. She was a widow when I \\nmarried her, with three children, one smaller than the other. \\nShe married her first husband, an infantry officer, for love, \\nand ran away with him from her father’s house. She was \\nexceedingly fond of her husband; but he gave way to cards, \\ngot into trouble and with that he died. He used to beat her \\n27\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nat the end: and although she paid him back, of which I have \\nauthentic documentary evidence, to this day she speaks of \\nhim with tears and she throws him up to me; and I am glad, \\nI am glad that, though only in imagination, she should think \\nof herself as having once been happy…. And she was left at \\nhis death with three children in a wild and remote district \\nwhere I happened to be at the time; and she was left in such \\nhopeless poverty that, although I have seen many ups and \\ndowns of all sort, I don’t feel equal to describing it even. Her \\nrelations had all thrown her off. And she was proud, too, \\nexcessively proud…. And then, honoured sir, and then, I, \\nbeing at the time a widower, with a daughter of fourteen \\nleft me by my first wife, offered her my hand, for I could not \\nbear the sight of such suffering. You can judge the extremity \\nof her calamities, that she, a woman of education and cul-\\nture and distinguished family, should have consented to be \\nmy wife. But she did! Weeping and sobbing and wringing \\nher hands, she married me! For she had nowhere to turn! \\nDo you understand, sir, do you understand what it means \\nwhen you have absolutely nowhere to turn? No, that you \\ndon’t understand yet…. And for a whole year, I performed \\nmy duties conscientiously and faithfully, and did not touch \\nthis’ (he tapped the jug with his finger), ‘for I have feelings. \\nBut even so, I could not please her; and then I lost my place \\ntoo, and that through no fault of mine but through changes \\nin the office; and then I did touch it! … It will be a year and \\na half ago soon since we found ourselves at last after many \\nwanderings and numerous calamities in this magnificent \\ncapital, adorned with innumerable monuments. Here I ob-\\nCrime and Punishment\\n28\\ntained a situation…. I obtained it and I lost it again. Do you \\nunderstand? This time it was through my own fault I lost \\nit: for my weakness had come out…. We have now part of \\na room at Amalia Fyodorovna Lippevechsel’s; and what we \\nlive upon and what we pay our rent with, I could not say. \\nThere are a lot of people living there besides ourselves. Dirt \\nand disorder, a perfect Bedlam … hm … yes … And mean-\\nwhile my daughter by my first wife has grown up; and what \\nmy daughter has had to put up with from her step-mother \\nwhilst she was growing up, I won’t speak of. For, though \\nKaterina Ivanovna is full of generous feelings, she is a spir-\\nited lady, irritable and short—tempered…. Yes. But it’s no \\nuse going over that! Sonia, as you may well fancy, has had \\nno education. I did make an effort four years ago to give her \\na course of geography and universal history, but as I was \\nnot very well up in those subjects myself and we had no \\nsuitable books, and what books we had … hm, anyway we \\nhave not even those now, so all our instruction came to an \\nend. We stopped at Cyrus of Persia. Since she has attained \\nyears of maturity, she has read other books of romantic ten-\\ndency and of late she had read with great interest a book \\nshe got through Mr. Lebeziatnikov, Lewes’ Physiology—do \\nyou know it?—and even recounted extracts from it to us: \\nand that’s the whole of her education. And now may I ven-\\nture to address you, honoured sir, on my own account with \\na private question. Do you suppose that a respectable poor \\ngirl can earn much by honest work? Not fifteen farthings a \\nday can she earn, if she is respectable and has no special tal-\\nent and that without putting her work down for an instant! \\n29\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nAnd what’s more, Ivan Ivanitch Klopstock the civil counsel-\\nlor—have you heard of him?—has not to this day paid her \\nfor the half-dozen linen shirts she made him and drove her \\nroughly away, stamping and reviling her, on the pretext that \\nthe shirt collars were not made like the pattern and were \\nput in askew. And there are the little ones hungry…. And \\nKaterina Ivanovna walking up and down and wringing her \\nhands, her cheeks flushed red, as they always are in that dis-\\nease: ‘Here you live with us,’ says she, ‘you eat and drink and \\nare kept warm and you do nothing to help.’ And much she \\ngets to eat and drink when there is not a crust for the little \\nones for three days! I was lying at the time … well, what of \\nit! I was lying drunk and I heard my Sonia speaking (she \\nis a gentle creature with a soft little voice … fair hair and \\nsuch a pale, thin little face). She said: ‘Katerina Ivanovna, \\nam I really to do a thing like that?’ And Darya Frantsov-\\nna, a woman of evil character and very well known to the \\npolice, had two or three times tried to get at her through \\nthe landlady. ‘And why not?’ said Katerina Ivanovna with \\na jeer, ‘you are something mighty precious to be so careful \\nof!’ But don’t blame her, don’t blame her, honoured sir, don’t \\nblame her! She was not herself when she spoke, but driven \\nto distraction by her illness and the crying of the hungry \\nchildren; and it was said more to wound her than anything \\nelse…. For that’s Katerina Ivanovna’s character, and when \\nchildren cry, even from hunger, she falls to beating them \\nat once. At six o’clock I saw Sonia get up, put on her ker-\\nchief and her cape, and go out of the room and about nine \\no’clock she came back. She walked straight up to Katerina \\nCrime and Punishment\\n30\\nIvanovna and she laid thirty roubles on the table before her \\nin silence. She did not utter a word, she did not even look at \\nher, she simply picked up our big green drap de dames shawl \\n(we have a shawl, made of drap de dames), put it over her \\nhead and face and lay down on the bed with her face to the \\nwall; only her little shoulders and her body kept shudder-\\ning…. And I went on lying there, just as before…. And then \\nI saw, young man, I saw Katerina Ivanovna, in the same si-\\nlence go up to Sonia’s little bed; she was on her knees all the \\nevening kissing Sonia’s feet, and would not get up, and then \\nthey both fell asleep in each other’s arms … together, to-\\ngether … yes … and I … lay drunk.’\\nMarmeladov stopped short, as though his voice had \\nfailed him. Then he hurriedly filled his glass, drank, and \\ncleared his throat.\\n‘Since then, sir,’ he went on after a brief pause—‘Since \\nthen, owing to an unfortunate occurrence and through in-\\nformation given by evil- intentioned persons—in all which \\nDarya Frantsovna took a leading part on the pretext that \\nshe had been treated with want of respect—since then my \\ndaughter Sofya Semyonovna has been forced to take a yel-\\nlow ticket, and owing to that she is unable to go on living \\nwith us. For our landlady, Amalia Fyodorovna would not \\nhear of it (though she had backed up Darya Frantsovna be-\\nfore) and Mr. Lebeziatnikov too … hm…. All the trouble \\nbetween him and Katerina Ivanovna was on Sonia’s ac-\\ncount. At first he was for making up to Sonia himself and \\nthen all of a sudden he stood on his dignity: ‘how,’ said he, \\n‘can a highly educated man like me live in the same rooms \\n31\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nwith a girl like that?’ And Katerina Ivanovna would not let \\nit pass, she stood up for her … and so that’s how it hap-\\npened. And Sonia comes to us now, mostly after dark; she \\ncomforts Katerina Ivanovna and gives her all she can…. \\nShe has a room at the Kapernaumovs’ the tailors, she lodges \\nwith them; Kapernaumov is a lame man with a cleft palate \\nand all of his numerous family have cleft palates too. And \\nhis wife, too, has a cleft palate. They all live in one room, \\nbut Sonia has her own, partitioned off…. Hm … yes … very \\npoor people and all with cleft palates … yes. Then I got up \\nin the morning, and put on my rags, lifted up my hands to \\nheaven and set off to his excellency Ivan Afanasyvitch. His \\nexcellency Ivan Afanasyvitch, do you know him? No? Well, \\nthen, it’s a man of God you don’t know. He is wax … wax \\nbefore the face of the Lord; even as wax melteth! … His eyes \\nwere dim when he heard my story. ‘Marmeladov, once al-\\nready you have deceived my expectations … I’ll take you \\nonce more on my own responsibility’—that’s what he said, \\n‘remember,’ he said, ‘and now you can go.’ I kissed the dust \\nat his feet—in thought only, for in reality he would not have \\nallowed me to do it, being a statesman and a man of modern \\npolitical and enlightened ideas. I returned home, and when \\nI announced that I’d been taken back into the service and \\nshould receive a salary, heavens, what a to-do there was …!’\\nMarmeladov stopped again in violent excitement. At \\nthat moment a whole party of revellers already drunk came \\nin from the street, and the sounds of a hired concertina and \\nthe cracked piping voice of a child of seven singing ‘The \\nHamlet’ were heard in the entry. The room was filled with \\nCrime and Punishment\\n32\\nnoise. The tavern-keeper and the boys were busy with the \\nnew-comers. Marmeladov paying no attention to the new \\narrivals continued his story. He appeared by now to be ex-\\ntremely weak, but as he became more and more drunk, he \\nbecame more and more talkative. The recollection of his re-\\ncent success in getting the situation seemed to revive him, \\nand was positively reflected in a sort of radiance on his face. \\nRaskolnikov listened attentively.\\n‘That was five weeks ago, sir. Yes…. As soon as Kateri-\\nna Ivanovna and Sonia heard of it, mercy on us, it was as \\nthough I stepped into the kingdom of Heaven. It used to \\nbe: you can lie like a beast, nothing but abuse. Now they \\nwere walking on tiptoe, hushing the children. ‘Semyon Za-\\nharovitch is tired with his work at the office, he is resting, \\nshh!’ They made me coffee before I went to work and boiled \\ncream for me! They began to get real cream for me, do you \\nhear that? And how they managed to get together the mon-\\ney for a decent outfit— eleven roubles, fifty copecks, I can’t \\nguess. Boots, cotton shirt- fronts—most magnificent, a uni-\\nform, they got up all in splendid style, for eleven roubles and \\na half. The first morning I came back from the office I found \\nKaterina Ivanovna had cooked two courses for dinner—\\nsoup and salt meat with horse radish—which we had never \\ndreamed of till then. She had not any dresses … none at all, \\nbut she got herself up as though she were going on a visit; \\nand not that she’d anything to do it with, she smartened her-\\nself up with nothing at all, she’d done her hair nicely, put on \\na clean collar of some sort, cuffs, and there she was, quite a \\ndifferent person, she was younger and better looking. Sonia, \\n33\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nmy little darling, had only helped with money ‘for the time,’ \\nshe said, ‘it won’t do for me to come and see you too often. \\nAfter dark maybe when no one can see.’ Do you hear, do \\nyou hear? I lay down for a nap after dinner and what do you \\nthink: though Katerina Ivanovna had quarrelled to the last \\ndegree with our landlady Amalia Fyodorovna only a week \\nbefore, she could not resist then asking her in to coffee. For \\ntwo hours they were sitting, whispering together. ‘Semyon \\nZaharovitch is in the service again, now, and receiving a \\nsalary,’ says she, ‘and he went himself to his excellency and \\nhis excellency himself came out to him, made all the others \\nwait and led Semyon Zaharovitch by the hand before every-\\nbody into his study.’ Do you hear, do you hear? ‘To be sure,’ \\nsays he, ‘Semyon Zaharovitch, remembering your past ser-\\nvices,’ says he, ‘and in spite of your propensity to that foolish \\nweakness, since you promise now and since moreover we’ve \\ngot on badly without you,’ (do you hear, do you hear;) ‘and \\nso,’ says he, ‘I rely now on your word as a gentleman.’ And \\nall that, let me tell you, she has simply made up for herself, \\nand not simply out of wantonness, for the sake of bragging; \\nno, she believes it all herself, she amuses herself with her \\nown fancies, upon my word she does! And I don’t blame her \\nfor it, no, I don’t blame her! … Six days ago when I brought \\nher my first earnings in full—twenty-three roubles forty co-\\npecks altogether—she called me her poppet: ‘poppet,’ said \\nshe, ‘my little poppet.’ And when we were by ourselves, you \\nunderstand? You would not think me a beauty, you would \\nnot think much of me as a husband, would you? … Well, \\nshe pinched my cheek, ‘my little poppet,’ said she.’\\nCrime and Punishment\\n34\\nMarmeladov broke off, tried to smile, but suddenly his \\nchin began to twitch. He controlled himself however. The \\ntavern, the degraded appearance of the man, the five nights \\nin the hay barge, and the pot of spirits, and yet this poignant \\nlove for his wife and children bewildered his listener. Ras-\\nkolnikov listened intently but with a sick sensation. He felt \\nvexed that he had come here.\\n‘Honoured sir, honoured sir,’ cried Marmeladov recov-\\nering himself— ‘Oh, sir, perhaps all this seems a laughing \\nmatter to you, as it does to others, and perhaps I am only \\nworrying you with the stupidity of all the trivial details of \\nmy home life, but it is not a laughing matter to me. For I can \\nfeel it all…. And the whole of that heavenly day of my life \\nand the whole of that evening I passed in fleeting dreams \\nof how I would arrange it all, and how I would dress all the \\nchildren, and how I should give her rest, and how I should \\nrescue my own daughter from dishonour and restore her to \\nthe bosom of her family…. And a great deal more…. Quite \\nexcusable, sir. Well, then, sir’ (Marmeladov suddenly gave \\na sort of start, raised his head and gazed intently at his lis-\\ntener) ‘well, on the very next day after all those dreams, that \\nis to say, exactly five days ago, in the evening, by a cunning \\ntrick, like a thief in the night, I stole from Katerina Ivanov-\\nna the key of her box, took out what was left of my earnings, \\nhow much it was I have forgotten, and now look at me, all \\nof you! It’s the fifth day since I left home, and they are look-\\ning for me there and it’s the end of my employment, and \\nmy uniform is lying in a tavern on the Egyptian bridge. I \\nexchanged it for the garments I have on … and it’s the end \\n35\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nof everything!’\\nMarmeladov struck his forehead with his fist, clenched \\nhis teeth, closed his eyes and leaned heavily with his elbow \\non the table. But a minute later his face suddenly changed \\nand with a certain assumed slyness and affectation of bra-\\nvado, he glanced at Raskolnikov, laughed and said:\\n‘This morning I went to see Sonia, I went to ask her for a \\npick-me-up! He-he-he!’\\n‘You don’t say she gave it to you?’ cried one of the new-\\ncomers; he shouted the words and went off into a guffaw.\\n‘This very quart was bought with her money,’ Marmeladov \\ndeclared, addressing himself exclusively to Raskolnikov. \\n‘Thirty copecks she gave me with her own hands, her last, \\nall she had, as I saw…. She said nothing, she only looked at \\nme without a word…. Not on earth, but up yonder … they \\ngrieve over men, they weep, but they don’t blame them, \\nthey don’t blame them! But it hurts more, it hurts more \\nwhen they don’t blame! Thirty copecks yes! And maybe \\nshe needs them now, eh? What do you think, my dear sir? \\nFor now she’s got to keep up her appearance. It costs mon-\\ney, that smartness, that special smartness, you know? Do \\nyou understand? And there’s pomatum, too, you see, she \\nmust have things; petticoats, starched ones, shoes, too, real \\njaunty ones to show off her foot when she has to step over \\na puddle. Do you understand, sir, do you understand what \\nall that smartness means? And here I, her own father, here \\nI took thirty copecks of that money for a drink! And I am \\ndrinking it! And I have already drunk it! Come, who will \\nhave pity on a man like me, eh? Are you sorry for me, sir, or \\nCrime and Punishment\\n36\\nnot? Tell me, sir, are you sorry or not? He-he-he!’\\nHe would have filled his glass, but there was no drink left. \\nThe pot was empty.\\n‘What are you to be pitied for?’ shouted the tavern-keeper \\nwho was again near them.\\nShouts of laughter and even oaths followed. The laughter \\nand the oaths came from those who were listening and also \\nfrom those who had heard nothing but were simply looking \\nat the figure of the discharged government clerk.\\n‘To be pitied! Why am I to be pitied?’ Marmeladov sud-\\ndenly declaimed, standing up with his arm outstretched, as \\nthough he had been only waiting for that question.\\n‘Why am I to be pitied, you say? Yes! there’s nothing to \\npity me for! I ought to be crucified, crucified on a cross, not \\npitied! Crucify me, oh judge, crucify me but pity me! And \\nthen I will go of myself to be crucified, for it’s not merry-\\nmaking I seek but tears and tribulation! … Do you suppose, \\nyou that sell, that this pint of yours has been sweet to me? It \\nwas tribulation I sought at the bottom of it, tears and tribu-\\nlation, and have found it, and I have tasted it; but He will \\npity us Who has had pity on all men, Who has understood \\nall men and all things, He is the One, He too is the judge. \\nHe will come in that day and He will ask: ‘Where is the \\ndaughter who gave herself for her cross, consumptive step-\\nmother and for the little children of another? Where is the \\ndaughter who had pity upon the filthy drunkard, her earth-\\nly father, undismayed by his beastliness?’ And He will say, \\n‘Come to me! I have already forgiven thee once…. I have \\nforgiven thee once…. Thy sins which are many are forgiv-\\n37\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nen thee for thou hast loved much….’ And he will forgive \\nmy Sonia, He will forgive, I know it … I felt it in my heart \\nwhen I was with her just now! And He will judge and will \\nforgive all, the good and the evil, the wise and the meek…. \\nAnd when He has done with all of them, then He will sum-\\nmon us. ‘You too come forth,’ He will say, ‘Come forth ye \\ndrunkards, come forth, ye weak ones, come forth, ye chil-\\ndren of shame!’ And we shall all come forth, without shame \\nand shall stand before him. And He will say unto us, ‘Ye are \\nswine, made in the Image of the Beast and with his mark; \\nbut come ye also!’ And the wise ones and those of under-\\nstanding will say, ‘Oh Lord, why dost Thou receive these \\nmen?’ And He will say, ‘This is why I receive them, oh ye \\nwise, this is why I receive them, oh ye of understanding, \\nthat not one of them believed himself to be worthy of this.’ \\nAnd He will hold out His hands to us and we shall fall down \\nbefore him … and we shall weep … and we shall under-\\nstand all things! Then we shall understand all! … and all \\nwill understand, Katerina Ivanovna even … she will under-\\nstand…. Lord, Thy kingdom come!’ And he sank down on \\nthe bench exhausted, and helpless, looking at no one, ap-\\nparently oblivious of his surroundings and plunged in deep \\nthought. His words had created a certain impression; there \\nwas a moment of silence; but soon laughter and oaths were \\nheard again.\\n‘That’s his notion!’\\n‘Talked himself silly!’\\n‘A fine clerk he is!’\\nAnd so on, and so on.\\nCrime and Punishment\\n38\\n‘Let us go, sir,’ said Marmeladov all at once, raising his \\nhead and addressing Raskolnikov—‘come along with me … \\nKozel’s house, looking into the yard. I’m going to Katerina \\nIvanovna—time I did.’\\nRaskolnikov had for some time been wanting to go and \\nhe had meant to help him. Marmeladov was much unsteadi-\\ner on his legs than in his speech and leaned heavily on the \\nyoung man. They had two or three hundred paces to go. The \\ndrunken man was more and more overcome by dismay and \\nconfusion as they drew nearer the house.\\n‘It’s not Katerina Ivanovna I am afraid of now,’ he mut-\\ntered in agitation—‘and that she will begin pulling my hair. \\nWhat does my hair matter! Bother my hair! That’s what \\nI say! Indeed it will be better if she does begin pulling it, \\nthat’s not what I am afraid of … it’s her eyes I am afraid of \\n… yes, her eyes … the red on her cheeks, too, frightens me \\n… and her breathing too…. Have you noticed how people in \\nthat disease breathe … when they are excited? I am fright-\\nened of the children’s crying, too…. For if Sonia has not \\ntaken them food … I don’t know what’s happened! I don’t \\nknow! But blows I am not afraid of…. Know, sir, that such \\nblows are not a pain to me, but even an enjoyment. In fact I \\ncan’t get on without it…. It’s better so. Let her strike me, it \\nrelieves her heart … it’s better so … There is the house. The \\nhouse of Kozel, the cabinet-maker … a German, well-to-do. \\nLead the way!’\\nThey went in from the yard and up to the fourth storey. \\nThe staircase got darker and darker as they went up. It was \\nnearly eleven o’clock and although in summer in Peters-\\n39\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nburg there is no real night, yet it was quite dark at the top \\nof the stairs.\\nA grimy little door at the very top of the stairs stood ajar. \\nA very poor-looking room about ten paces long was light-\\ned up by a candle-end; the whole of it was visible from the \\nentrance. It was all in disorder, littered up with rags of all \\nsorts, especially children’s garments. Across the furthest \\ncorner was stretched a ragged sheet. Behind it probably was \\nthe bed. There was nothing in the room except two chairs \\nand a sofa covered with American leather, full of holes, be-\\nfore which stood an old deal kitchen-table, unpainted and \\nuncovered. At the edge of the table stood a smoldering \\ntallow-candle in an iron candlestick. It appeared that the \\nfamily had a room to themselves, not part of a room, but \\ntheir room was practically a passage. The door leading to \\nthe other rooms, or rather cupboards, into which Amalia \\nLippevechsel’s flat was divided stood half open, and there \\nwas shouting, uproar and laughter within. People seemed to \\nbe playing cards and drinking tea there. Words of the most \\nunceremonious kind flew out from time to time.\\nRaskolnikov recognised Katerina Ivanovna at once. She \\nwas a rather tall, slim and graceful woman, terribly emaci-\\nated, with magnificent dark brown hair and with a hectic \\nflush in her cheeks. She was pacing up and down in her little \\nroom, pressing her hands against her chest; her lips were \\nparched and her breathing came in nervous broken gasps. \\nHer eyes glittered as in fever and looked about with a harsh \\nimmovable stare. And that consumptive and excited face \\nwith the last flickering light of the candle-end playing upon \\nCrime and Punishment\\n40\\nit made a sickening impression. She seemed to Raskolnikov \\nabout thirty years old and was certainly a strange wife for \\nMarmeladov…. She had not heard them and did not notice \\nthem coming in. She seemed to be lost in thought, hear-\\ning and seeing nothing. The room was close, but she had \\nnot opened the window; a stench rose from the staircase, \\nbut the door on to the stairs was not closed. From the inner \\nrooms clouds of tobacco smoke floated in, she kept cough-\\ning, but did not close the door. The youngest child, a girl of \\nsix, was asleep, sitting curled up on the floor with her head \\non the sofa. A boy a year older stood crying and shaking in \\nthe corner, probably he had just had a beating. Beside him \\nstood a girl of nine years old, tall and thin, wearing a thin \\nand ragged chemise with an ancient cashmere pelisse flung \\nover her bare shoulders, long outgrown and barely reach-\\ning her knees. Her arm, as thin as a stick, was round her \\nbrother’s neck. She was trying to comfort him, whispering \\nsomething to him, and doing all she could to keep him from \\nwhimpering again. At the same time her large dark eyes, \\nwhich looked larger still from the thinness of her frightened \\nface, were watching her mother with alarm. Marmeladov \\ndid not enter the door, but dropped on his knees in the very \\ndoorway, pushing Raskolnikov in front of him. The woman \\nseeing a stranger stopped indifferently facing him, coming \\nto herself for a moment and apparently wondering what he \\nhad come for. But evidently she decided that he was going \\ninto the next room, as he had to pass through hers to get \\nthere. Taking no further notice of him, she walked towards \\nthe outer door to close it and uttered a sudden scream on \\n41\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nseeing her husband on his knees in the doorway.\\n‘Ah!’ she cried out in a frenzy, ‘he has come back! The \\ncriminal! the monster! … And where is the money? What’s \\nin your pocket, show me! And your clothes are all different! \\nWhere are your clothes? Where is the money! Speak!’\\nAnd she fell to searching him. Marmeladov submissively \\nand obediently held up both arms to facilitate the search. \\nNot a farthing was there.\\n‘Where is the money?’ she cried—‘Mercy on us, can he \\nhave drunk it all? There were twelve silver roubles left in the \\nchest!’ and in a fury she seized him by the hair and dragged \\nhim into the room. Marmeladov seconded her efforts by \\nmeekly crawling along on his knees.\\n‘And this is a consolation to me! This does not hurt me, \\nbut is a positive con-so-la-tion, ho-nou-red sir,’ he called \\nout, shaken to and fro by his hair and even once striking \\nthe ground with his forehead. The child asleep on the floor \\nwoke up, and began to cry. The boy in the corner losing all \\ncontrol began trembling and screaming and rushed to his \\nsister in violent terror, almost in a fit. The eldest girl was \\nshaking like a leaf.\\n‘He’s drunk it! he’s drunk it all,’ the poor woman \\nscreamed in despair —‘and his clothes are gone! And they \\nare hungry, hungry!’—and wringing her hands she point-\\ned to the children. ‘Oh, accursed life! And you, are you not \\nashamed?’—she pounced all at once upon Raskolnikov—\\n‘from the tavern! Have you been drinking with him? You \\nhave been drinking with him, too! Go away!’\\nThe young man was hastening away without uttering a \\nCrime and Punishment\\n42\\nword. The inner door was thrown wide open and inquisitive \\nfaces were peering in at it. Coarse laughing faces with pipes \\nand cigarettes and heads wearing caps thrust themselves in \\nat the doorway. Further in could be seen figures in dress-\\ning gowns flung open, in costumes of unseemly scantiness, \\nsome of them with cards in their hands. They were particu-\\nlarly diverted, when Marmeladov, dragged about by his hair, \\nshouted that it was a consolation to him. They even began \\nto come into the room; at last a sinister shrill outcry was \\nheard: this came from Amalia Lippevechsel herself push-\\ning her way amongst them and trying to restore order after \\nher own fashion and for the hundredth time to frighten the \\npoor woman by ordering her with coarse abuse to clear out \\nof the room next day. As he went out, Raskolnikov had time \\nto put his hand into his pocket, to snatch up the coppers he \\nhad received in exchange for his rouble in the tavern and \\nto lay them unnoticed on the window. Afterwards on the \\nstairs, he changed his mind and would have gone back.\\n‘What a stupid thing I’ve done,’ he thought to himself, \\n‘they have Sonia and I want it myself.’ But reflecting that \\nit would be impossible to take it back now and that in any \\ncase he would not have taken it, he dismissed it with a wave \\nof his hand and went back to his lodging. ‘Sonia wants po-\\nmatum too,’ he said as he walked along the street, and he \\nlaughed malignantly—‘such smartness costs money…. Hm! \\nAnd maybe Sonia herself will be bankrupt to-day, for there \\nis always a risk, hunting big game … digging for gold … \\nthen they would all be without a crust to-morrow except \\nfor my money. Hurrah for Sonia! What a mine they’ve dug \\n43\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nthere! And they’re making the most of it! Yes, they are mak-\\ning the most of it! They’ve wept over it and grown used to it. \\nMan grows used to everything, the scoundrel!’\\nHe sank into thought.\\n‘And what if I am wrong,’ he cried suddenly after a mo-\\nment’s thought. ‘What if man is not really a scoundrel, man \\nin general, I mean, the whole race of mankind—then all the \\nrest is prejudice, simply artificial terrors and there are no \\nbarriers and it’s all as it should be.’\\nCrime and Punishment\\n44\\n']"

       "['\\nW\\nhen he went into Sonia’s room, it was already getting \\ndark. All day Sonia had been waiting for him in ter-\\nrible anxiety. Dounia had been waiting with her. She had \\ncome to her that morning, remembering Svidrigaïlov’s \\nwords that Sonia knew. We will not describe the conver-\\nsation and tears of the two girls, and how friendly they \\nbecame. Dounia gained one comfort at least from that in-\\nterview, that her brother would not be alone. He had gone \\nto her, Sonia, first with his confession; he had gone to her \\nfor human fellowship when he needed it; she would go with \\nhim wherever fate might send him. Dounia did not ask, but \\nshe knew it was so. She looked at Sonia almost with rever-\\nence and at first almost embarrassed her by it. Sonia was \\nalmost on the point of tears. She felt herself, on the contrary, \\nhardly worthy to look at Dounia. Dounia’s gracious image \\nwhen she had bowed to her so attentively and respectfully at \\ntheir first meeting in Raskolnikov’s room had remained in \\nher mind as one of the fairest visions of her life.\\nDounia at last became impatient and, leaving Sonia, went \\nto her brother’s room to await him there; she kept thinking \\nthat he would come there first. When she had gone, Sonia \\nbegan to be tortured by the dread of his committing suicide, \\nand Dounia too feared it. But they had spent the day trying \\nto persuade each other that that could not be, and both were \\nCrime and Punishment\\n730\\nless anxious while they were together. As soon as they part-\\ned, each thought of nothing else. Sonia remembered how \\nSvidrigaïlov had said to her the day before that Raskolnikov \\nhad two alternatives—Siberia or … Besides she knew his \\nvanity, his pride and his lack of faith.\\n‘Is it possible that he has nothing but cowardice and fear \\nof death to make him live?’ she thought at last in despair.\\nMeanwhile the sun was setting. Sonia was standing in \\ndejection, looking intently out of the window, but from it \\nshe could see nothing but the unwhitewashed blank wall \\nof the next house. At last when she began to feel sure of his \\ndeath—he walked into the room.\\nShe gave a cry of joy, but looking carefully into his face \\nshe turned pale.\\n‘Yes,’ said Raskolnikov, smiling. ‘I have come for your \\ncross, Sonia. It was you told me to go to the cross-roads; \\nwhy is it you are frightened now it’s come to that?’\\nSonia gazed at him astonished. His tone seemed strange \\nto her; a cold shiver ran over her, but in a moment she \\nguessed that the tone and the words were a mask. He spoke \\nto her looking away, as though to avoid meeting her eyes.\\n‘You see, Sonia, I’ve decided that it will be better so. \\nThere is one fact…. But it’s a long story and there’s no need \\nto discuss it. But do you know what angers me? It annoys \\nme that all those stupid brutish faces will be gaping at me \\ndirectly, pestering me with their stupid questions, which \\nI shall have to answer—they’ll point their fingers at me…. \\nTfoo! You know I am not going to Porfiry, I am sick of him. \\nI’d rather go to my friend, the Explosive Lieutenant; how \\n731\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nI shall surprise him, what a sensation I shall make! But I \\nmust be cooler; I’ve become too irritable of late. You know I \\nwas nearly shaking my fist at my sister just now, because she \\nturned to take a last look at me. It’s a brutal state to be in! \\nAh! what am I coming to! Well, where are the crosses?’\\nHe seemed hardly to know what he was doing. He could \\nnot stay still or concentrate his attention on anything; his \\nideas seemed to gallop after one another, he talked incoher-\\nently, his hands trembled slightly.\\nWithout a word Sonia took out of the drawer two crosses, \\none of cypress wood and one of copper. She made the sign \\nof the cross over herself and over him, and put the wooden \\ncross on his neck.\\n‘It’s the symbol of my taking up the cross,’ he laughed. \\n‘As though I had not suffered much till now! The wooden \\ncross, that is the peasant one; the copper one, that is Lizave-\\nta’s—you will wear yourself, show me! So she had it on … at \\nthat moment? I remember two things like these too, a silver \\none and a little ikon. I threw them back on the old wom-\\nan’s neck. Those would be appropriate now, really, those are \\nwhat I ought to put on now…. But I am talking nonsense \\nand forgetting what matters; I’m somehow forgetful…. You \\nsee I have come to warn you, Sonia, so that you might know \\n… that’s all— that’s all I came for. But I thought I had more \\nto say. You wanted me to go yourself. Well, now I am going \\nto prison and you’ll have your wish. Well, what are you cry-\\ning for? You too? Don’t. Leave off! Oh, how I hate it all!’\\nBut his feeling was stirred; his heart ached, as he looked \\nat her. ‘Why is she grieving too?’ he thought to himself. \\nCrime and Punishment\\n732\\n‘What am I to her? Why does she weep? Why is she looking \\nafter me, like my mother or Dounia? She’ll be my nurse.’\\n‘Cross yourself, say at least one prayer,’ Sonia begged in a \\ntimid broken voice.\\n‘Oh certainly, as much as you like! And sincerely, Sonia, \\nsincerely….’\\nBut he wanted to say something quite different.\\nHe crossed himself several times. Sonia took up her \\nshawl and put it over her head. It was the green drap de \\ndames shawl of which Marmeladov had spoken, ‘the fam-\\nily shawl.’ Raskolnikov thought of that looking at it, but \\nhe did not ask. He began to feel himself that he was cer-\\ntainly forgetting things and was disgustingly agitated. He \\nwas frightened at this. He was suddenly struck too by the \\nthought that Sonia meant to go with him.\\n‘What are you doing? Where are you going? Stay here, \\nstay! I’ll go alone,’ he cried in cowardly vexation, and al-\\nmost resentful, he moved towards the door. ‘What’s the use \\nof going in procession?’ he muttered going out.\\nSonia remained standing in the middle of the room. He \\nhad not even said good-bye to her; he had forgotten her. A \\npoignant and rebellious doubt surged in his heart.\\n‘Was it right, was it right, all this?’ he thought again as \\nhe went down the stairs. ‘Couldn’t he stop and retract it all \\n… and not go?’\\nBut still he went. He felt suddenly once for all that he \\nmustn’t ask himself questions. As he turned into the street \\nhe remembered that he had not said good-bye to Sonia, that \\nhe had left her in the middle of the room in her green shawl, \\n733\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nnot daring to stir after he had shouted at her, and he stopped \\nshort for a moment. At the same instant, another thought \\ndawned upon him, as though it had been lying in wait to \\nstrike him then.\\n‘Why, with what object did I go to her just now? I told \\nher—on business; on what business? I had no sort of busi-\\nness! To tell her I was going; but where was the need? Do I \\nlove her? No, no, I drove her away just now like a dog. Did I \\nwant her crosses? Oh, how low I’ve sunk! No, I wanted her \\ntears, I wanted to see her terror, to see how her heart ached! \\nI had to have something to cling to, something to delay me, \\nsome friendly face to see! And I dared to believe in myself, \\nto dream of what I would do! I am a beggarly contemptible \\nwretch, contemptible!’\\nHe walked along the canal bank, and he had not much \\nfurther to go. But on reaching the bridge he stopped and \\nturning out of his way along it went to the Hay Market.\\nHe looked eagerly to right and left, gazed intently at \\nevery object and could not fix his attention on anything; \\neverything slipped away. ‘In another week, another month \\nI shall be driven in a prison van over this bridge, how shall \\nI look at the canal then? I should like to remember this!’ \\nslipped into his mind. ‘Look at this sign! How shall I read \\nthose letters then? It’s written here ‘Campany,’ that’s a \\nthing to remember, that letter a and to look at it again in \\na month—how shall I look at it then? What shall I be feel-\\ning and thinking then? … How trivial it all must be, what \\nI am fretting about now! Of course it must all be interest-\\ning … in its way … (Ha-ha-ha! What am I thinking about?) \\nCrime and Punishment\\n734\\nI am becoming a baby, I am showing off to myself; why am I \\nashamed? Foo! how people shove! that fat man—a German \\nhe must be—who pushed against me, does he know whom \\nhe pushed? There’s a peasant woman with a baby, begging. \\nIt’s curious that she thinks me happier than she is. I might \\ngive her something, for the incongruity of it. Here’s a five \\ncopeck piece left in my pocket, where did I get it? Here, here \\n… take it, my good woman!’\\n‘God bless you,’ the beggar chanted in a lachrymose \\nvoice.\\nHe went into the Hay Market. It was distasteful, very dis-\\ntasteful to be in a crowd, but he walked just where he saw \\nmost people. He would have given anything in the world to \\nbe alone; but he knew himself that he would not have re-\\nmained alone for a moment. There was a man drunk and \\ndisorderly in the crowd; he kept trying to dance and falling \\ndown. There was a ring round him. Raskolnikov squeezed \\nhis way through the crowd, stared for some minutes at \\nthe drunken man and suddenly gave a short jerky laugh. \\nA minute later he had forgotten him and did not see him, \\nthough he still stared. He moved away at last, not remem-\\nbering where he was; but when he got into the middle of the \\nsquare an emotion suddenly came over him, overwhelming \\nhim body and mind.\\nHe suddenly recalled Sonia’s words, ‘Go to the cross-\\nroads, bow down to the people, kiss the earth, for you have \\nsinned against it too, and say aloud to the whole world, ‘I \\nam a murderer.’’ He trembled, remembering that. And \\nthe hopeless misery and anxiety of all that time, especial-\\n735\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nly of the last hours, had weighed so heavily upon him that \\nhe positively clutched at the chance of this new unmixed, \\ncomplete sensation. It came over him like a fit; it was like a \\nsingle spark kindled in his soul and spreading fire through \\nhim. Everything in him softened at once and the tears start-\\ned into his eyes. He fell to the earth on the spot….\\nHe knelt down in the middle of the square, bowed down \\nto the earth, and kissed that filthy earth with bliss and rap-\\nture. He got up and bowed down a second time.\\n‘He’s boozed,’ a youth near him observed.\\nThere was a roar of laughter.\\n‘He’s going to Jerusalem, brothers, and saying good-bye \\nto his children and his country. He’s bowing down to all \\nthe world and kissing the great city of St. Petersburg and its \\npavement,’ added a workman who was a little drunk.\\n‘Quite a young man, too!’ observed a third.\\n‘And a gentleman,’ someone observed soberly.\\n‘There’s no knowing who’s a gentleman and who isn’t \\nnowadays.’\\nThese exclamations and remarks checked Raskolnikov, \\nand the words, ‘I am a murderer,’ which were perhaps on \\nthe point of dropping from his lips, died away. He bore \\nthese remarks quietly, however, and, without looking \\nround, he turned down a street leading to the police office. \\nHe had a glimpse of something on the way which did not \\nsurprise him; he had felt that it must be so. The second time \\nhe bowed down in the Hay Market he saw, standing fifty \\npaces from him on the left, Sonia. She was hiding from him \\nbehind one of the wooden shanties in the market-place. She \\nCrime and Punishment\\n736\\nhad followed him then on his painful way! Raskolnikov at \\nthat moment felt and knew once for all that Sonia was with \\nhim for ever and would follow him to the ends of the earth, \\nwherever fate might take him. It wrung his heart … but he \\nwas just reaching the fatal place.\\nHe went into the yard fairly resolutely. He had to mount \\nto the third storey. ‘I shall be some time going up,’ he \\nthought. He felt as though the fateful moment was still far \\noff, as though he had plenty of time left for consideration.\\nAgain the same rubbish, the same eggshells lying about \\non the spiral stairs, again the open doors of the flats, again \\nthe same kitchens and the same fumes and stench coming \\nfrom them. Raskolnikov had not been here since that day. \\nHis legs were numb and gave way under him, but still they \\nmoved forward. He stopped for a moment to take breath, \\nto collect himself, so as to enter like a man. ‘But why? what \\nfor?’ he wondered, reflecting. ‘If I must drink the cup what \\ndifference does it make? The more revolting the better.’ He \\nimagined for an instant the figure of the ‘explosive lieuten-\\nant,’ Ilya Petrovitch. Was he actually going to him? Couldn’t \\nhe go to someone else? To Nikodim Fomitch? Couldn’t he \\nturn back and go straight to Nikodim Fomitch’s lodgings? \\nAt least then it would be done privately…. No, no! To the ‘ex-\\nplosive lieutenant’! If he must drink it, drink it off at once.\\nTurning cold and hardly conscious, he opened the door \\nof the office. There were very few people in it this time—\\nonly a house porter and a peasant. The doorkeeper did not \\neven peep out from behind his screen. Raskolnikov walked \\ninto the next room. ‘Perhaps I still need not speak,’ passed \\n737\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nthrough his mind. Some sort of clerk not wearing a uniform \\nwas settling himself at a bureau to write. In a corner anoth-\\ner clerk was seating himself. Zametov was not there, nor, of \\ncourse, Nikodim Fomitch.\\n‘No one in?’ Raskolnikov asked, addressing the person \\nat the bureau.\\n‘Whom do you want?’\\n‘A-ah! Not a sound was heard, not a sight was seen, but \\nI scent the Russian … how does it go on in the fairy tale … \\nI’ve forgotten! ‘At your service!’’ a familiar voice cried sud-\\ndenly.\\nRaskolnikov shuddered. The Explosive Lieutenant stood \\nbefore him. He had just come in from the third room. ‘It is \\nthe hand of fate,’ thought Raskolnikov. ‘Why is he here?’\\n‘You’ve come to see us? What about?’ cried Ilya Petro-\\nvitch. He was obviously in an exceedingly good humour \\nand perhaps a trifle exhilarated. ‘If it’s on business you are \\nrather early.[*] It’s only a chance that I am here … however \\nI’ll do what I can. I must admit, I … what is it, what is it? \\nExcuse me….’\\n[*] Dostoevsky appears to have forgotten that it is after \\nsunset, and that the last time Raskolnikov visited the police \\noffice at two in the afternoon he was reproached for coming \\ntoo late.—TRANSLATOR.\\n‘Raskolnikov.’\\n‘Of course, Raskolnikov. You didn’t imagine I’d forgotten? \\nDon’t think I am like that … Rodion Ro—Ro—Rodiono-\\nvitch, that’s it, isn’t it?’\\n‘Rodion Romanovitch.’\\nCrime and Punishment\\n738\\n‘Yes, yes, of course, Rodion Romanovitch! I was just get-\\nting at it. I made many inquiries about you. I assure you I’ve \\nbeen genuinely grieved since that … since I behaved like \\nthat … it was explained to me afterwards that you were a \\nliterary man … and a learned one too … and so to say the \\nfirst steps … Mercy on us!

Of course, you’ve made friends, I heard. Well, \\nno, Zametov is not here. Yes, we’ve lost Zametov. He’s not \\nbeen here since yesterday … he quarrelled with everyone on \\n739\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nleaving … in the rudest way.

He wanted to go in for some examination, but it’s only \\nto talk and boast about it, it will go no further than that. Of \\ncourse it’s a very different matter with you or Mr. Razumi-\\nhin there, your friend. Your career is an intellectual one and \\nyou won’t be deterred by failure. For you, one may say, all \\nthe attractions of life nihil est—you are an ascetic, a monk, \\na hermit! … A book, a pen behind your ear, a learned re-\\nsearch—that’s where your spirit soars! I am the same way \\nmyself…. Have you read Livingstone’s Travels?’\\n‘No.’\\n‘Oh, I have. There are a great many Nihilists about nowa-\\ndays, you know, and indeed it is not to be wondered at.

I am married and have children, I fulfil the \\nduties of a man and a citizen, but who is he, may I ask? I ap-\\npeal to you as a man ennobled by education … Then these \\nmidwives, too, have become extraordinarily numerous.’\\nRaskolnikov raised his eyebrows inquiringly. The words \\nof Ilya Petrovitch, who had obviously been dining, were for \\nthe most part a stream of empty sounds for him. But some \\nof them he understood. He looked at him inquiringly, not \\nknowing how it would end.\\n‘I mean those crop-headed wenches,’ the talkative Ilya \\nPetrovitch continued. ‘Midwives is my name for them. I \\nthink it a very satisfactory one, ha-ha! They go to the Acad-\\nemy, study anatomy. If I fall ill, am I to send for a young \\nlady to treat me? What do you say? Ha-ha!’ Ilya Petrovitch \\nlaughed, quite pleased with his own wit. ‘It’s an immoderate \\nzeal for education, but once you’re educated, that’s enough. \\nWhy abuse it? Why insult honourable people, as that scoun-\\ndrel Zametov does? Why did he insult me, I ask you? Look \\nat these suicides, too, how common they are, you can’t fan-\\ncy!

He had lost his wife, was a man of reckless \\nhabits and all of a sudden shot himself, and in such a shock-\\ning way…. He left in his notebook a few words: that he dies \\nin full possession of his faculties and that no one is to blame \\nfor his death. He had money, they say. How did you come \\nto know him?’\\n‘I … was acquainted … my sister was governess in his \\nfamily.’\\n‘Bah-bah-bah! Then no doubt you can tell us something \\nabout him.

He began going down \\nthe stairs, supporting himself with his right hand against \\nthe wall. He fancied that a porter pushed past him on his \\nCrime and Punishment\\n742\\nway upstairs to the police office, that a dog in the lower \\nstorey kept up a shrill barking and that a woman flung a \\nrolling-pin at it and shouted. He went down and out into \\nthe yard. There, not far from the entrance, stood Sonia, pale \\nand horror- stricken. She looked wildly at him. He stood \\nstill before her. There was a look of poignant agony, of de-\\nspair, in her face. She clasped her hands. His lips worked in \\nan ugly, meaningless smile.

       "'On a hot July evening, a young man named Raskolnikov leaves his lodging and walks towards a bridge in Petersburg, Russia. He is anxious about encountering his landlady, whom he owes money, and prefers to sneak in and out of the building unnoticed. As he walks, he reflects on his plans for a potential crime and his fear of taking action. He also notes the oppressive heat, the dirty surroundings, and the drunk men he passes by. Raskolnikov enters a tavern and sits down, ordering a beer. He observes the other patrons, including a drunk man singing a song and a group of men and a girl with a concertina. He is particularly drawn to a man named Marmeladov, a former government clerk who appears unkempt and disheveled. Marmeladov approaches Raskolnikov and strikes up a conversation, sharing his life story and expressing his shame and guilt over his alcoholism and inability to provide for his family. Marmeladov describes his wife, Katerina Ivanovna, and their three children, as well as his stepdaughter, Sonia, who has had to resort to prostitution to support the family. Despite his remorse, Marmeladov reveals that he recently stole the remaining earnings he had intended to give to his family and spent it on alcohol. Raskolnikov, feeling disturbed by Marmeladov\\'s story, leaves the tavern and heads towards Marmeladov\\'s home. As he approaches, he hears shouting and sees Katerina Ivanovna in a distressed state, searching Marmeladov for money. Marmeladov kneels before her and accepts her abuse, while the children look on in fear. Raskolnikov tries to leave, but Katerina Ivanovna accuses him of drinking with her husband and orders him to go. As he departs, he places some coins on the windowsill, intending them for the children, but then changes his mind and keeps the money for himself. He reflects on the situation, thinking about Sonia and the risks she takes to support her family, and justifies his own actions by concluding that \"man is not really a scoundrel.\"'"

       "['On a hot July evening, a young man named Raskolnikov leaves his lodging and walks towards a bridge in Petersburg, Russia. He is anxious about encountering his landlady, as he owes her money and has been avoiding her. Raskolnikov is in a state of mental distress, feeling isolated and overwhelmed by his poverty. He contemplates taking a \"new step\" that seems to involve some kind of criminal act, but he is hesitant and filled with self-doubt. As he walks, he observes the squalor and drunkenness around him, which further distresses him. He reaches the apartment of an elderly pawn broker, Alyona Ivanovna, from whom he has previously pawned items. He plans to pawn a watch, but the transaction does not go as he expected, and he leaves feeling frustrated and ashamed. \\n\\nRaskolnikov enters a tavern, where he encounters a drunk man named Marmeladov, who starts a long, rambling monologue. Marmeladov reveals details about his life, including his alcoholism, his unemployed status, and his family. He has a wife, Katerina Ivanovna, and three children from a previous marriage, as well as a daughter, Sonia, from his current marriage. They live in poverty, and Katerina Ivanovna works tirelessly to support the family. Marmeladov confesses that he has recently stolen money from his wife and squandered it on alcohol. Despite his remorse, he continues to drink. Raskolnikov is intrigued by Marmeladov\\'s story and finds himself drawn into the man\\'s personal troubles. \\n\\nMarmeladov invites Raskolnikov to his home, and they arrive to find Katerina Ivanovna in a distressed state. She is upset because Marmeladov has returned drunk and has wasted their money. She accuses him of being a criminal and a monster, and the children are terrified. Raskolnikov feels pity for the family, especially when he sees the children\\'s suffering. He leaves without drawing attention to himself, feeling conflicted about his own plans and the misery he has witnessed. As he walks away, he ponders the nature of humanity, questioning whether people are inherently scoundrels or if there are no moral barriers at all.',\n",
       " \"Raskolnikov wakes up after a broken sleep and is in a foul mood. His room is small and shabby, with old furniture and thick dust covering his books and manuscripts. He is visited by Nastasya, the cook and only servant, who brings him tea and tells him that his landlady intends to report him to the police for unpaid rent. Raskolnikov asks Nastasya to buy him some food and offers to pay her back. She tells him about his mother's letter, which she had forgotten to give him earlier. He becomes excited and asks her to leave so that he can read it in private.\\n\\nThe letter is from Raskolnikov's mother, Pulcheria Raskolnikov, who writes about the recent troubles of his sister, Dunya. Dunya had been working as a governess for the Svidrigaïlov family, where she endured rude and disrespectful treatment from Mr. Svidrigaïlov. The situation escalated when Mr. Svidrigaïlov made an inappropriate proposal to Dunya, which was witnessed by his wife, Marfa Petrovna. Dunya was sent away abruptly, causing a scandal that damaged her reputation. However, Marfa Petrovna later discovered evidence of Dunya's innocence and worked to restore her reputation.\\n\\nPulcheria goes on to share the news that Dunya has received a marriage proposal from Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, a well-to-do man with two government posts. Although there is no strong love between them, Dunya has accepted the proposal as she believes it will provide her with financial stability and the opportunity to support her family. Pulcheria expresses her hope that Luzhin will also be able to help Raskolnikov with his university studies and future career. She also mentions that she and Dunya plan to travel to Petersburg soon, and she promises to send him some money.\\n\\nRaskolnikov is deeply disturbed by the letter, especially the news of Dunya's impending marriage to Luzhin. He feels that his mother and sister are sacrificing themselves for his sake, and he is determined to prevent the marriage. He questions their decision and wonders if they truly understand what they are getting into. He is angry at the idea of Dunya being reduced to a legal concubine and feels that she is selling herself for his sake. He struggles with the thought of sacrificing his moral freedom and independence for the sake of comfort and stability.\\n\\nRaskolnikov's thoughts turn to the broader issue of women being forced into degrading situations due to poverty. He reflects on the life of Sonia Marmeladov, who has had to resort to prostitution to support her family. He questions the morality of such sacrifices and wonders if they are ever truly worth it. He feels a sense of powerlessness and frustration as he considers the limited options available to women like Dunya and Sonia.\\n\\nAs Raskolnikov continues to walk, he encounters a drunk young girl who is being followed by a suspicious-looking gentleman. Raskolnikov intervenes and tries to protect the girl from the man, enlisting the help of a police constable. However, he suddenly changes his mind and tells the constable to let the man have the girl, reflecting on the futility of his actions and the limited impact he can have on such situations. He feels a sense of despair and powerlessness as he watches the girl walk away.\\n\\nRaskolnikov's thoughts turn to his university comrade, Razumihin, whom he has not seen in four months. He wonders why he had the urge to visit Razumihin and decides to go to his apartment.\",\n",
       " \"Raskolnikov ponders his financial situation and considers asking Razumikhin for help, but ultimately decides against it. He feels agitated and cannot explain why he is going to see Razumikhin. He has a vivid dream about a mare being brutally beaten to death, which leaves him shaken. He questions his plan to murder the pawnbroker, but ultimately feels a sense of relief and peace as if a burden has been lifted from him. He crosses a bridge and notices the Neva River and the sunset, feeling a sense of freedom. He reflects on a chance encounter with a student and an officer discussing the pawnbroker, Alyona Ivanovna, and her sister, Lizaveta. The student suggests killing the old woman and using her money for good deeds, which leaves Raskolnikov agitated. He returns home and sleeps for a long time. The next day, he makes preparations for the murder, including sewing a noose into his overcoat and hiding an axe. He is concerned about being noticed by Nastasya, but luck seems to be on his side as he manages to obtain the axe without being seen. He reflects on the psychological aspects of crime and his own state of mind. He reaches the pawnbroker's house and rings the bell, hearing someone approach the door from the inside.\",\n",
       " 'The protagonist, Raskolnikov, arrives at the apartment of a pawnbroker, Alyona Ivanovna, whom he plans to murder. He enters the apartment and is confronted by the old woman, who becomes suspicious of his presence. Despite his efforts to appear calm, he loses his composure and attacks her with an axe, killing her. He then proceeds to search the apartment for valuables, but is interrupted by the unexpected arrival of Lizaveta, the sister of Alyona Ivanovna. In a panic, he kills Lizaveta as well. As he attempts to flee, he encounters two men, Koch and a young man, who are visiting the apartment. He manages to escape unnoticed and returns home, where he hides the stolen items and falls into a feverish sleep. The next day, he receives a summons from the police, but it turns out to be regarding an unpaid debt. At the police station, he overhears a conversation between an officer, Nikodim Fomitch, and Ilya Petrovitch, who are discussing the murders. They mention that the suspects, Pestryakov and Koch, have alibis, and the case remains unresolved. Raskolnikov faints and is questioned by Nikodim Fomitch about his illness. He leaves the police station, aware that a search will be conducted soon.',\n",
       " \"Raskolnikov, a young man, is anxious about something he has done. He returns to his room and finds it empty. He retrieves some items he had hidden in a hole, including jewellery and a purse, and puts them in his pockets. He leaves his room and walks quickly, fearing that he will be pursued. He plans to dispose of the items in a canal, but changes his mind and decides to hide them in a secluded area instead. However, he struggles to find a suitable location and becomes increasingly paranoid, feeling that people are staring at him suspiciously. Eventually, he finds a secluded courtyard and hides the items under a large stone. He feels a sense of relief and joy, but this is short-lived as he encounters people and places that remind him of his past. He visits his friend Razumihin, who offers him work translating a German text. Raskolnikov accepts the money but soon returns it, feeling conflicted. He wanders aimlessly and is given money by a woman who mistakes him for a beggar. He stands on a bridge and contemplates the water, feeling disconnected from his past self. He returns home and falls into a feverish sleep, during which he experiences disturbing dreams and hallucinations. When he wakes, he overhears a violent argument between his landlady and Ilya Petrovitch, which further distresses him. Razumihin visits and tells Raskolnikov that he has been ill and delirious. He also mentions that a messenger has brought money from Raskolnikov's mother. Raskolnikov is suspicious and confused, but eventually accepts the money. Razumihin buys him new clothes and offers to help him get back on his feet.\",\n",
       " \"In a cramped apartment, the doctor, Zossimov, examines Raskolnikov, a former student, who is recovering from an illness. Razumihin, Raskolnikov's friend, is also present. They discuss a recent murder of a pawnbroker and her sister, and Razumihin reveals that a house painter, Nikolai, has been arrested for the crime. He recounts the evidence against Nikolai, including the discovery of stolen earrings in his possession. However, Razumihin believes that Nikolai is innocent, citing his character and the implausibility of his alleged actions. He argues that the real murderer is still at large. Raskolnikov listens intently, showing signs of distress. A visitor, Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, arrives and introduces himself as Raskolnikov's mother's fiancé. Luzhin's pompous and self-important manner irritates Raskolnikov, who insults him and demands that he leave. After Luzhin's departure, the conversation returns to the murder, with Razumihin and Zossimov debating the criminal's identity and motives. Raskolnikov becomes agitated, revealing his strong interest in the case.\",\n",
       " \"Raskolnikov leaves his apartment and walks to the Hay Market, where he listens to a street singer and gives her money. He talks to a stranger about his love of street music, then continues on to the corner where he had previously met the pawnbroker and her sister. He asks a young man about the pawnbroker's booth, then continues on to V. He feels strangely drawn to this area, which is full of drinking establishments and women. He listens to a singer in one of the establishments and considers going inside, but decides against it. He talks to a woman named Duclida, who asks him for money, and he gives her fifteen copecks. He then goes to a restaurant and asks for newspapers from the past five days, as well as tea. He reads about the murders of the pawnbroker and her sister, and is joined by Zametov, who sits down at his table. Raskolnikov asks Zametov about the murders, and the two engage in a strange conversation in which Raskolnikov hints that he may be the murderer. Zametov becomes alarmed and leaves, and Raskolnikov follows soon after. He encounters Razumihin on the stairs and they argue, with Razumihin insisting that Raskolnikov come to his housewarming party. Raskolnikov refuses and walks away. He goes to a bridge and leans on the railing, lost in thought. He witnesses a woman jump into the canal and is disturbed by the incident. He decides to go to the police station to confess to the murders, but on the way, he stops at the scene of the murders and talks to the workmen who are redecorating the apartment. He rings the bell several times and asks about the murders, then leaves. He encounters a crowd gathered around a carriage, where a man has been run over. He recognizes the man as Marmeladov, Katerina Ivanovna's husband, and helps to bring him to her apartment. Marmeladov is dying, and a priest is called to give him last rites. Marmeladov's daughter Sonia arrives, and he dies in her arms. Raskolnikov gives Katerina Ivanovna twenty roubles to help with expenses, then leaves. He encounters Polenka, Marmeladov's other daughter, who gives him a message from Sonia and kisses him. Raskolnikov goes to Razumihin's housewarming party, where he meets Zossimov and Razumihin. He tells them that he is feeling weak and needs to go home, and they accompany him. When they arrive at his apartment, they find his mother and sister waiting for him. Raskolnikov is overwhelmed and faints.\",\n",
       " \"Raskolnikov is agitated and irritable when his mother, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, and sister, Avdotya Romanovna, arrive in St. Petersburg.

       " 'Raskolnikov is visited by his mother, Pulcheria, and sister, Dunya, who have recently arrived in St. Petersburg. They are joined by Razumihin and Zossimov, a doctor who has been caring for Raskolnikov. Zossimov notes Raskolnikov\\'s improved health but also his strange, agitated state. Raskolnikov\\'s mother and sister are concerned about his well-being and the state of his living quarters. They discuss the possibility of Raskolnikov returning to university, and Raskolnikov expresses a desire to make amends for his past actions. The conversation turns to Marfa, the wife of Svidrigailov, who has recently died. Dunya and Pulcheria reveal that they received a letter from Luzhin, Dunya\\'s suitor, who requests that Raskolnikov not be present at their meeting that evening. Raskolnikov is upset by this and insists on attending. He also learns that Luzhin has slandered him in the letter, accusing him of giving money to a woman of \"notorious behavior.\"\\n\\nSonia, Marmeladov\\'s daughter, arrives and invites Raskolnikov to the funeral of her father. Raskolnikov is struck by Sonia\\'s humble demeanor and kind eyes. He offers his assistance with the funeral arrangements and asks her to visit him the following day. After Sonia leaves, Raskolnikov and Razumihin set out to meet Porfiry, a police investigator, regarding some pawned items. On the way, they encounter a man who appears to be following Sonia. They arrive at Porfiry\\'s office, and Raskolnikov is keen to gauge whether Porfiry suspects him of the murders.',\n",
       " 'Raskolnikov enters Porfiry Petrovitch\\'s room with Razumihin, who is acting awkwardly and aggressively. They are greeted by Porfiry, who is jovial and curious about their visit. Raskolnikov tries to control his laughter at Razumihin\\'s behaviour, but fails, and the scene becomes chaotic. Zametov is also present, which surprises Raskolnikov. He attempts to explain his presence, but is interrupted by Razumihin\\'s outbursts. The group discusses the recent murder, and Raskolnikov tries to feign embarrassment about his pawned items. Porfiry suggests he write a letter to retrieve them, but Raskolnikov is concerned about the financial implications. The conversation turns to the topic of crime, with Razumihin passionately arguing against the idea that crime is solely caused by environmental factors. Raskolnikov joins the discussion, presenting his theory that some individuals are \"extraordinary\" and have the right to commit crimes if it serves a higher purpose. He uses historical figures like Napoleon as examples. Porfiry asks Raskolnikov if he believes in God and the resurrection, to which Raskolnikov replies affirmatively. The conversation shifts to the practical implications of Raskolnikov\\'s theory, and Porfiry asks if he would condone murder for personal gain. Raskolnikov responds that such an act would depend on the individual\\'s conscience. As Raskolnikov and Razumihin leave, Porfiry asks about painters who were working in the building on the day of the murder, testing Raskolnikov\\'s memory. Raskolnikov denies seeing them, but his reaction raises Razumihin\\'s suspicions. They part ways, with Razumihin determined to confront Porfiry about his suspicions.

Raskolnikov, intrigued and disturbed, questions Svidrigaïlov's sanity but listens as he explains his intentions towards Avdotya.
