On a hot July evening, a young man named Raskolnikov leaves his lodging and walks towards a bridge in Petersburg, Russia. He is anxious about encountering his landlady, as he owes her money and has been avoiding her. Raskolnikov is in a state of mental distress, feeling isolated and overwhelmed by his poverty. He contemplates taking a "new step" that seems to involve some kind of criminal act, but he is hesitant and filled with self-doubt. As he walks, he observes the squalor and drunkenness around him, which further distresses him. He reaches the apartment of an elderly pawn broker, Alyona Ivanovna, from whom he has previously pawned items. He plans to pawn a watch, but the transaction does not go as he expected, and he leaves feeling frustrated and ashamed. 

Raskolnikov enters a tavern, where he encounters a drunk man named Marmeladov, who starts a long, rambling monologue. Marmeladov reveals details about his life, including his alcoholism, his unemployed status, and his family. He has a wife, Katerina Ivanovna, and three children from a previous marriage, as well as a daughter, Sonia, from his current marriage. They live in poverty, and Katerina Ivanovna works tirelessly to support the family. Marmeladov confesses that he has recently stolen money from his wife and squandered it on alcohol. Despite his remorse, he continues to drink. Raskolnikov is intrigued by Marmeladov's story and finds himself drawn into the man's personal troubles. 

Marmeladov invites Raskolnikov to his home, and they arrive to find Katerina Ivanovna in a distressed state. She is upset because Marmeladov has returned drunk and has wasted their money. She accuses him of being a criminal and a monster, and the children are terrified. Raskolnikov feels pity for the family, especially when he sees the children's suffering. He leaves without drawing attention to himself, feeling conflicted about his own plans and the misery he has witnessed. As he walks away, he ponders the nature of humanity, questioning whether people are inherently scoundrels or if there are no moral barriers at all.

Raskolnikov wakes up after a broken sleep and is in a foul mood. His room is small and shabby, with old furniture and thick dust covering his books and manuscripts. He is visited by Nastasya, the cook and only servant, who brings him tea and tells him that his landlady intends to report him to the police for unpaid rent. Raskolnikov asks Nastasya to buy him some food and offers to pay her back. She tells him about his mother's letter, which she had forgotten to give him earlier. He becomes excited and asks her to leave so that he can read it in private.

The letter is from Raskolnikov's mother, Pulcheria Raskolnikov, who writes about the recent troubles of his sister, Dunya. Dunya had been working as a governess for the Svidrigaïlov family, where she endured rude and disrespectful treatment from Mr. Svidrigaïlov. The situation escalated when Mr. Svidrigaïlov made an inappropriate proposal to Dunya, which was witnessed by his wife, Marfa Petrovna. Dunya was sent away abruptly, causing a scandal that damaged her reputation. However, Marfa Petrovna later discovered evidence of Dunya's innocence and worked to restore her reputation.

Pulcheria goes on to share the news that Dunya has received a marriage proposal from Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, a well-to-do man with two government posts. Although there is no strong love between them, Dunya has accepted the proposal as she believes it will provide her with financial stability and the opportunity to support her family. Pulcheria expresses her hope that Luzhin will also be able to help Raskolnikov with his university studies and future career. She also mentions that she and Dunya plan to travel to Petersburg soon, and she promises to send him some money.

Raskolnikov is deeply disturbed by the letter, especially the news of Dunya's impending marriage to Luzhin. He feels that his mother and sister are sacrificing themselves for his sake, and he is determined to prevent the marriage. He questions their decision and wonders if they truly understand what they are getting into. He is angry at the idea of Dunya being reduced to a legal concubine and feels that she is selling herself for his sake. He struggles with the thought of sacrificing his moral freedom and independence for the sake of comfort and stability.

Raskolnikov's thoughts turn to the broader issue of women being forced into degrading situations due to poverty. He reflects on the life of Sonia Marmeladov, who has had to resort to prostitution to support her family. He questions the morality of such sacrifices and wonders if they are ever truly worth it. He feels a sense of powerlessness and frustration as he considers the limited options available to women like Dunya and Sonia.

As Raskolnikov continues to walk, he encounters a drunk young girl who is being followed by a suspicious-looking gentleman. Raskolnikov intervenes and tries to protect the girl from the man, enlisting the help of a police constable. However, he suddenly changes his mind and tells the constable to let the man have the girl, reflecting on the futility of his actions and the limited impact he can have on such situations. He feels a sense of despair and powerlessness as he watches the girl walk away.

Raskolnikov's thoughts turn to his university comrade, Razumihin, whom he has not seen in four months. He wonders why he had the urge to visit Razumihin and decides to go to his apartment.

Raskolnikov ponders his financial situation and considers asking Razumikhin for help, but ultimately decides against it. He feels agitated and cannot explain why he is going to see Razumikhin. He has a vivid dream about a mare being brutally beaten to death, which leaves him shaken. He questions his plan to murder the pawnbroker, but ultimately feels a sense of relief and peace as if a burden has been lifted from him. He crosses a bridge and notices the Neva River and the sunset, feeling a sense of freedom. He reflects on a chance encounter with a student and an officer discussing the pawnbroker, Alyona Ivanovna, and her sister, Lizaveta. The student suggests killing the old woman and using her money for good deeds, which leaves Raskolnikov agitated. He returns home and sleeps for a long time. The next day, he makes preparations for the murder, including sewing a noose into his overcoat and hiding an axe. He is concerned about being noticed by Nastasya, but luck seems to be on his side as he manages to obtain the axe without being seen. He reflects on the psychological aspects of crime and his own state of mind. He reaches the pawnbroker's house and rings the bell, hearing someone approach the door from the inside.

The protagonist, Raskolnikov, arrives at the apartment of a pawnbroker, Alyona Ivanovna, whom he plans to murder. He enters the apartment and is confronted by the old woman, who becomes suspicious of his presence. Despite his efforts to appear calm, he loses his composure and attacks her with an axe, killing her. He then proceeds to search the apartment for valuables, but is interrupted by the unexpected arrival of Lizaveta, the sister of Alyona Ivanovna. In a panic, he kills Lizaveta as well. As he attempts to flee, he encounters two men, Koch and a young man, who are visiting the apartment. He manages to escape unnoticed and returns home, where he hides the stolen items and falls into a feverish sleep. The next day, he receives a summons from the police, but it turns out to be regarding an unpaid debt. At the police station, he overhears a conversation between an officer, Nikodim Fomitch, and Ilya Petrovitch, who are discussing the murders. They mention that the suspects, Pestryakov and Koch, have alibis, and the case remains unresolved. Raskolnikov faints and is questioned by Nikodim Fomitch about his illness. He leaves the police station, aware that a search will be conducted soon.

Raskolnikov, a young man, is anxious about something he has done. He returns to his room and finds it empty. He retrieves some items he had hidden in a hole, including jewellery and a purse, and puts them in his pockets. He leaves his room and walks quickly, fearing that he will be pursued. He plans to dispose of the items in a canal, but changes his mind and decides to hide them in a secluded area instead. However, he struggles to find a suitable location and becomes increasingly paranoid, feeling that people are staring at him suspiciously. Eventually, he finds a secluded courtyard and hides the items under a large stone. He feels a sense of relief and joy, but this is short-lived as he encounters people and places that remind him of his past. He visits his friend Razumihin, who offers him work translating a German text. Raskolnikov accepts the money but soon returns it, feeling conflicted. He wanders aimlessly and is given money by a woman who mistakes him for a beggar. He stands on a bridge and contemplates the water, feeling disconnected from his past self. He returns home and falls into a feverish sleep, during which he experiences disturbing dreams and hallucinations. When he wakes, he overhears a violent argument between his landlady and Ilya Petrovitch, which further distresses him. Razumihin visits and tells Raskolnikov that he has been ill and delirious. He also mentions that a messenger has brought money from Raskolnikov's mother. Raskolnikov is suspicious and confused, but eventually accepts the money. Razumihin buys him new clothes and offers to help him get back on his feet.

In a cramped apartment, the doctor, Zossimov, examines Raskolnikov, a former student, who is recovering from an illness. Razumihin, Raskolnikov's friend, is also present. They discuss a recent murder of a pawnbroker and her sister, and Razumihin reveals that a house painter, Nikolai, has been arrested for the crime. He recounts the evidence against Nikolai, including the discovery of stolen earrings in his possession. However, Razumihin believes that Nikolai is innocent, citing his character and the implausibility of his alleged actions. He argues that the real murderer is still at large. Raskolnikov listens intently, showing signs of distress. A visitor, Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, arrives and introduces himself as Raskolnikov's mother's fiancé. Luzhin's pompous and self-important manner irritates Raskolnikov, who insults him and demands that he leave. After Luzhin's departure, the conversation returns to the murder, with Razumihin and Zossimov debating the criminal's identity and motives. Raskolnikov becomes agitated, revealing his strong interest in the case.

Raskolnikov leaves his apartment and walks to the Hay Market, where he listens to a street singer and gives her money. He talks to a stranger about his love of street music, then continues on to the corner where he had previously met the pawnbroker and her sister. He asks a young man about the pawnbroker's booth, then continues on to V. He feels strangely drawn to this area, which is full of drinking establishments and women. He listens to a singer in one of the establishments and considers going inside, but decides against it. He talks to a woman named Duclida, who asks him for money, and he gives her fifteen copecks. He then goes to a restaurant and asks for newspapers from the past five days, as well as tea. He reads about the murders of the pawnbroker and her sister, and is joined by Zametov, who sits down at his table. Raskolnikov asks Zametov about the murders, and the two engage in a strange conversation in which Raskolnikov hints that he may be the murderer. Zametov becomes alarmed and leaves, and Raskolnikov follows soon after. He encounters Razumihin on the stairs and they argue, with Razumihin insisting that Raskolnikov come to his housewarming party. Raskolnikov refuses and walks away. He goes to a bridge and leans on the railing, lost in thought. He witnesses a woman jump into the canal and is disturbed by the incident. He decides to go to the police station to confess to the murders, but on the way, he stops at the scene of the murders and talks to the workmen who are redecorating the apartment. He rings the bell several times and asks about the murders, then leaves. He encounters a crowd gathered around a carriage, where a man has been run over. He recognizes the man as Marmeladov, Katerina Ivanovna's husband, and helps to bring him to her apartment. Marmeladov is dying, and a priest is called to give him last rites. Marmeladov's daughter Sonia arrives, and he dies in her arms. Raskolnikov gives Katerina Ivanovna twenty roubles to help with expenses, then leaves. He encounters Polenka, Marmeladov's other daughter, who gives him a message from Sonia and kisses him. Raskolnikov goes to Razumihin's housewarming party, where he meets Zossimov and Razumihin. He tells them that he is feeling weak and needs to go home, and they accompany him. When they arrive at his apartment, they find his mother and sister waiting for him. Raskolnikov is overwhelmed and faints.

Raskolnikov is agitated and irritable when his mother, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, and sister, Avdotya Romanovna, arrive in St. Petersburg. He asks them to leave, but they are distressed and confused by his behavior. They are accompanied by Razumihin, a friend of Raskolnikov who has been looking after him during his illness. Razumihin tries to reassure the women and offers to help them find accommodation. He also promises to keep an eye on Raskolnikov and provide updates on his condition. Later, Razumihin confesses his love for Avdotya Romanovna, but she does not reciprocate his feelings.

The next morning, Razumihin reflects on his behavior the previous day and feels ashamed of his drunkenness and jealousy. He visits Raskolnikov, who is still sleeping, and then goes to see Zossimov, a doctor who has been treating Raskolnikov. They discuss Raskolnikov's mental state and the possible causes of his illness. Razumihin expresses concern about the influence of Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, Avdotya Romanovna's fiancé, on the family.

Razumihin visits the women at their lodgings and tells them about Raskolnikov's life over the past year. He describes Raskolnikov as proud, haughty, and moody, but also kind-hearted. He also mentions a previous plan of Raskolnikov's to marry a girl, which fell through due to her death. Pulcheria Alexandrovna shares her worries about Luzhin, who has sent a letter requesting a meeting with Avdotya Romanovna without Raskolnikov present. Razumihin advises them to follow Avdotya Romanovna's decision, and they set off to see Raskolnikov.

Raskolnikov is visited by his mother, Pulcheria, and sister, Dunya, who have recently arrived in St. Petersburg. They are joined by Razumihin and Zossimov, a doctor who has been caring for Raskolnikov. Zossimov notes Raskolnikov's improved health but also his strange, agitated state. Raskolnikov's mother and sister are concerned about his well-being and the state of his living quarters. They discuss the possibility of Raskolnikov returning to university, and Raskolnikov expresses a desire to make amends for his past actions. The conversation turns to Marfa, the wife of Svidrigailov, who has recently died. Dunya and Pulcheria reveal that they received a letter from Luzhin, Dunya's suitor, who requests that Raskolnikov not be present at their meeting that evening. Raskolnikov is upset by this and insists on attending. He also learns that Luzhin has slandered him in the letter, accusing him of giving money to a woman of "notorious behavior."

Sonia, Marmeladov's daughter, arrives and invites Raskolnikov to the funeral of her father. Raskolnikov is struck by Sonia's humble demeanor and kind eyes. He offers his assistance with the funeral arrangements and asks her to visit him the following day. After Sonia leaves, Raskolnikov and Razumihin set out to meet Porfiry, a police investigator, regarding some pawned items. On the way, they encounter a man who appears to be following Sonia. They arrive at Porfiry's office, and Raskolnikov is keen to gauge whether Porfiry suspects him of the murders.

Raskolnikov enters Porfiry Petrovitch's room with Razumihin, who is acting awkwardly and aggressively. They are greeted by Porfiry, who is jovial and curious about their visit. Raskolnikov tries to control his laughter at Razumihin's behaviour, but fails, and the scene becomes chaotic. Zametov is also present, which surprises Raskolnikov. He attempts to explain his presence, but is interrupted by Razumihin's outbursts. The group discusses the recent murder, and Raskolnikov tries to feign embarrassment about his pawned items. Porfiry suggests he write a letter to retrieve them, but Raskolnikov is concerned about the financial implications. The conversation turns to the topic of crime, with Razumihin passionately arguing against the idea that crime is solely caused by environmental factors. Raskolnikov joins the discussion, presenting his theory that some individuals are "extraordinary" and have the right to commit crimes if it serves a higher purpose. He uses historical figures like Napoleon as examples. Porfiry asks Raskolnikov if he believes in God and the resurrection, to which Raskolnikov replies affirmatively. The conversation shifts to the practical implications of Raskolnikov's theory, and Porfiry asks if he would condone murder for personal gain. Raskolnikov responds that such an act would depend on the individual's conscience. As Raskolnikov and Razumihin leave, Porfiry asks about painters who were working in the building on the day of the murder, testing Raskolnikov's memory. Raskolnikov denies seeing them, but his reaction raises Razumihin's suspicions. They part ways, with Razumihin determined to confront Porfiry about his suspicions. Raskolnikov, meanwhile, is troubled by his encounter with a strange man who accused him of being a murderer. He returns to his room, feeling anxious and unwell.

In a surprising turn of events, Raskolnikov finds himself face-to-face with Svidrigaïlov, a man with a questionable past and an air of mystery. Svidrigaïlov reveals that he has come to make Raskolnikov's acquaintance and to seek his support in approaching Avdotya Romanovna, Raskolnikov's sister. He claims to have heard flattering things about Raskolnikov and expresses a desire to assist Avdotya, who may be prejudiced against him due to past events. Raskolnikov interrupts, stating that Svidrigaïlov's hopes are misplaced. Undeterred, Svidrigaïlov justifies his past actions, arguing that he was attracted to Avdotya and that his intentions were not criminal. Raskolnikov, disgusted, dismisses his justifications and insists that they want nothing to do with him.

Svidrigaïlov, unfazed, continues to engage Raskolnikov in conversation, revealing that he has recently lost his wife, Marfa Petrovna, due to a sudden illness. He muses on the nature of ghosts and shares his belief that they may exist, recounting his own experiences with apparitions. Raskolnikov, intrigued and disturbed, questions Svidrigaïlov's sanity but listens as he explains his intentions towards Avdotya. Svidrigaïlov proposes to offer Avdotya a substantial sum of money to break off her impending marriage with Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, which he believes will be detrimental to her. He insists that his motives are pure and that he no longer has romantic intentions towards her.

Raskolnikov, angered and suspicious, rejects Svidrigaïlov's proposal and demands that he leave. Svidrigaïlov, unperturbed, reveals that Marfa Petrovna left Avdotya a significant sum of money in her will. He reiterates his desire to meet with Avdotya and asks Raskolnikov to facilitate the encounter. Raskolnikov refuses, and Svidrigaïlov departs, leaving him with conflicting emotions.

The narrative shifts to a conversation between Raskolnikov and Razumihin, where Raskolnikov shares his concerns about Svidrigaïlov and his intentions towards Avdotya. They arrive at Bakaleyev's, where they are joined by Luzhin, who is seeking to reconcile with Avdotya and her mother, Pulcheria Alexandrovna. Luzhin reveals that Svidrigaïlov has arrived in Petersburg and expresses concern about his intentions. Pulcheria Alexandrovna fears for Avdotya's safety, recalling Svidrigaïlov's past behavior. Luzhin proceeds to share details of Svidrigaïlov's past, including his involvement in a criminal case that was hushed up by Marfa Petrovna.

Raskolnikov confirms that Svidrigaïlov has visited him and shares the details of their encounter, including Svidrigaïlov's proposal to Avdotya. Luzhin, feeling threatened, becomes increasingly agitated and demands an explanation for the disregard of his wishes. Avdotya, supported by her mother, insists that Luzhin's presence is contingent on his ability to reconcile with Raskolnikov. Luzhin, feeling slighted, becomes more hostile, leading to a heated exchange. Raskolnikov intervenes, and Luzhin storms out, leaving the family shaken.

Pyotr Petrovitch, a wealthy man who has worked his way up from insignificance, is enraged when his marriage proposal is rejected by Avdotya Romanovna, a young woman of good breeding who is currently in a vulnerable position. Pyotr feels entitled to Avdotya's hand in marriage, believing that he is doing her a heroic service by elevating her social status. He is shocked and humiliated by the rejection, which he attributes to the influence of Raskolnikov, Avdotya's brother. Pyotr's sense of self-importance and vanity are further wounded when he learns that Avdotya and her family no longer need his financial support. Meanwhile, Raskolnikov, who has been insistent on getting rid of Pyotr, suddenly announces that he will be leaving his family. He offers vague explanations for his departure, but his mother and sister are distraught. After Raskolnikov leaves, his friend Razumihin tries to comfort the family and proposes a business venture that could help them stay together. Raskolnikov, meanwhile, visits Sonia, a religious and compassionate young woman who has been forced into prostitution to support her family. He kisses her foot and confesses that he needs her, but his behavior is erratic and unsettling. He tells Sonia that he has abandoned his family and that they must go their separate ways from now on. He also hints at a terrible secret, suggesting that he knows the identity of Lizaveta's murderer. Sonia is left confused and distressed by Raskolnikov's words and behavior.

Raskolnikov arrives at the police station to meet Porfiry Petrovitch, the head of the investigation into the murders. He is surprised that he is not immediately questioned and suspects that he is being watched. When he is finally summoned, he finds Porfiry alone in his office. Their conversation is filled with innuendos and double meanings, with both men trying to gauge the other's knowledge of the crime. Raskolnikov becomes increasingly agitated, while Porfiry maintains a playful and enigmatic demeanor. He hints that he knows more than he lets on, but also suggests that he has no concrete evidence. Raskolnikov's anger gets the better of him, and he accuses Porfiry of playing games and trying to drive him insane. As their confrontation reaches a climax, a man named Nikolay suddenly bursts into the room and confesses to the murders. Porfiry is taken aback, but quickly resumes his interrogation, suspecting that Nikolay may be covering for someone else. After questioning Nikolay, he dismisses him and turns his attention back to Raskolnikov. He hints that he still has suspicions and that they will meet again. Raskolnikov leaves, feeling a mix of relief and unease. As he is about to enter his apartment, he encounters the man from the previous day, who confesses that he was the one who reported Raskolnikov's suspicious behavior to Porfiry. The man apologizes for his actions, and Raskolnikov, realizing that Porfiry has no concrete evidence against him, feels a sense of relief and newfound determination.

Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin is upset about his failed marriage proposal to Dunya, and he blames himself for not spending more money on her and her family. He is also irritated by various other inconveniences, including a legal case and a dispute with the owner of the flat he had intended to share with Dunya. He seeks comfort in his friend Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, but their relationship is strained as Pyotr Petrovitch suspects Andrey Semyonovitch of mocking him. Pyotr Petrovitch is curious about a memorial dinner being organized by Katerina Ivanovna, the widow of a government clerk, and he learns that Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov, Dunya's brother, will be in attendance. Pyotr Petrovitch is intrigued by Andrey Semyonovitch's progressive political views and seeks to learn more about them, but he finds Andrey Semyonovitch dull and simplistic. Pyotr Petrovitch also discovers that Andrey Semyonovitch has been involved in a scandal with Katerina Ivanovna, which further strains their relationship.

Pyotr Petrovitch and Andrey Semyonovitch discuss the upcoming memorial dinner, and Pyotr Petrovitch expresses his disdain for the event and its attendees. He is particularly critical of Katerina Ivanovna's spending on the dinner, considering her poverty. He also learns that Raskolnikov will be present, which piques his interest. Pyotr Petrovitch asks Andrey Semyonovitch to invite Sonia, Katerina Ivanovna's stepdaughter, to his room, as he wants to speak with her privately. He is concerned about the potential for scandal and asks Andrey Semyonovitch to stay as a witness. Pyotr Petrovitch offers Sonia a ten-rouble note as a charitable donation for Katerina Ivanovna, but his true intention is to impress Sonia and gain her favor. He also wants to assert his superiority over Katerina Ivanovna, whom he considers socially inferior.

Katerina Ivanovna is described as having a volatile personality, prone to sudden shifts in mood and behavior. She is proud and easily offended, especially when she feels that her social status is being questioned. The dinner she has organized is an attempt to assert her dignity and show that she is not inferior to the other lodgers. However, the event does not go as planned, as many of the invited guests fail to show up, and those who do attend are mostly drunk and disorderly. Katerina Ivanovna becomes increasingly irritated and insults her landlady, Amalia Ivanovna, as well as some of the guests. She tries to impress Raskolnikov by talking about her plans to open a boarding school and highlighting her aristocratic background. A dispute breaks out between Katerina Ivanovna and Amalia Ivanovna, with the former accusing the latter of having a low social status and a questionable past. The argument escalates, and Katerina Ivanovna threatens to tear off Amalia Ivanovna's cap. Pyotr Petrovitch arrives at this moment, witnessing the chaotic scene.

Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin accuses Sonia of stealing a hundred-rouble note from him, causing a commotion at Katerina Ivanovna's gathering. Luzhin's accusation is refuted by Lebeziatnikov, who witnessed Luzhin slipping the note into Sonia's pocket. Raskolnikov then reveals Luzhin's true motive: to discredit Sonia and drive a wedge between Raskolnikov and his family. Luzhin leaves in disgrace, and the gathering descends into chaos, with Katerina Ivanovna being evicted by the landlady, Amalia Ivanovna. Raskolnikov visits Sonia, intending to confess his murder of Lizaveta. He struggles to find the right moment and is overwhelmed by conflicting emotions. He eventually confesses, and Sonia is initially shocked and horrified. However, she quickly forgives him and pledges her unwavering support, even offering to accompany him to Siberia if necessary. Raskolnikov reveals that the police are on his trail, but he is confident that he will not be convicted due to a lack of evidence. He asks Sonia not to visit him in prison, and they part with a sense of shared burden and uncertainty about the future.

Lebeziatnikov informs Raskolnikov and Sonia that Katerina Ivanovna has gone mad. She has been thrown out of a general's house and is now threatening to make her children beg in the streets. Sonia rushes out to find her. Raskolnikov follows, leaving Lebeziatnikov behind. They find Katerina Ivanovna forcing her children to perform in the street to earn money. She has become delusional and is rambling incoherently. Raskolnikov tries to persuade her to stop, but she refuses. A police officer intervenes, but a kind official gives Katerina Ivanovna money and escorts her home. She collapses and dies soon after, surrounded by Sonia, Polenka, and the children. Svidrigaïlov appears and offers to pay for the funeral and to put the children in an orphanage. He also promises to help Sonia. Raskolnikov is disturbed by Svidrigaïlov's presence and his knowledge of Raskolnikov's relationship with Sonia. Razumihin visits Raskolnikov and confronts him about his strange behavior towards his mother and sister. He also reveals that he knows about Raskolnikov's involvement in a political conspiracy. Raskolnikov is relieved that Razumihin does not suspect him of the murders. Razumihin leaves, and Porfiry shows up at Raskolnikov's apartment. Raskolnikov is unafraid and feels ready to face whatever comes next.

Porfiry Petrovitch, a police investigator, meets with Rodion Romanovitch, the protagonist, and they discuss a recent murder. Porfiry reveals that he has been observing Rodion's behaviour and finds him suspicious. He mentions a previous encounter where Rodion lost his temper and left abruptly. Porfiry explains that he has been gathering evidence and analysing Rodion's psychological state, but he has not found any concrete proof of his guilt. He admits that he has been playing mind games with Rodion to provoke a reaction. He also mentions another suspect, Nikolay, who has confessed to the crime but whose story has inconsistencies. Porfiry believes that Rodion is the true murderer due to his intelligence and ability to plan such a crime. He encourages Rodion to confess, promising a reduced sentence and a chance for redemption. Rodion is conflicted but remains defiant, denying his involvement in the murder. He accuses Porfiry of manipulating him and trying to trap him into a confession. Porfiry admits that he doesn't have enough evidence to arrest Rodion yet and offers him a chance to surrender and make amends. Rodion is torn between his desire for freedom and the weight of his guilt. He considers the possibility of suicide but ultimately decides to continue living, hoping to find a purpose for his life.

Svidrigaïlov tells Raskolnikov about his marriage contract with his late wife, Marfa Petrovna, which allowed him to have affairs with maids, as long as she knew about them. He also reveals his obsession with Raskolnikov's sister, Avdotya Romanovna, and his plan to seduce her. He describes his tactics, which include feigning interest in her religious and moral beliefs to gain her sympathy. Despite his efforts, Avdotya Romanovna rejects him, and he becomes increasingly desperate and aggressive in his pursuit. Svidrigaïlov also mentions his interest in a 16-year-old girl, whom he intends to marry, and a 13-year-old girl he has taken under his protection. Raskolnikov is disgusted by Svidrigaïlov's behavior and resolves to keep an eye on him, suspecting that he still has designs on Avdotya Romanovna. Later, Svidrigaïlov meets with Avdotya Romanovna and reveals that he knows about Raskolnikov's crime, having overheard his confession to Sofya Semyonovna. He offers to help Raskolnikov escape abroad, but Avdotya Romanovna refuses and tries to leave. Svidrigaïlov locks the door and confesses his love for her, offering to do anything if she will reciprocate his feelings. When she rejects him again, he advances towards her, and she shoots at him, grazing his head. Svidrigaïlov is unharmed and lets her go, placing the key to the door on the table.

Svidrigaïlov spends an evening drinking and carousing in disreputable places, eventually ending up at a pleasure garden where he gets into a dispute with some clerks. He leaves and walks home in the pouring rain, before changing his mind and going to see Sonia. He gives her money and tells her that he may be going to America, also hinting at Raskolnikov's impending fate. After leaving Sonia, Svidrigaïlov visits his fiancée's parents and gives her a large sum of money, claiming that he has to leave Petersburg for a while. He then checks into a cheap hotel, where he has a disturbing dream about a drowned girl. The next morning, he encounters a young girl who has run away from home, and he takes her back to his room to warm up. However, he falls asleep and has another disturbing dream, this time about his fiancée. He wakes up and decides to go through with his plan, heading towards the Neva River. He encounters a man named Achilles, who tries to stop him from shooting himself, but Svidrigaïlov pulls the trigger anyway. Meanwhile, Raskolnikov visits his mother, Pulcheria, and tries to reassure her that he loves her and that he will face the consequences of his actions. He then goes to see his sister, Dounia, and confesses his crime to her. He tells her that he is going to turn himself in, and asks her to take care of their mother. Dounia is distraught but promises to do so, and Raskolnikov leaves, determined to face the consequences of his actions.

In the gathering dusk, Raskolnikov visits Sonia, who has been anxiously awaiting him with his sister, Dounia. Dounia has formed a bond with Sonia, realizing that her brother confided in her and valuing her unwavering support. Despite their efforts to reassure each other, both Sonia and Dounia fear that Raskolnikov might commit suicide. When Raskolnikov arrives, Sonia is startled by his strange demeanor and tone. He asks for a cross, indicating his decision to accept his fate and go to prison. His behavior is erratic, and he seems agitated and forgetful. He expresses disdain for the gawking crowds he will encounter and shares his intention to confess to the police lieutenant, Ilya Petrovitch, rather than Porfiry.

Raskolnikov's thoughts wander as he walks, and he finds himself at the Hay Market. He is overwhelmed by emotion and bows down to kiss the ground, an act that draws laughter and comments from onlookers. Unbeknownst to him, Sonia has followed him and witnesses this scene. Raskolnikov proceeds to the police station, where he encounters Ilya Petrovitch, who is in a jovial mood and apologizes for their previous encounter.
